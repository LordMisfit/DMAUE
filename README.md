nothing to see here folks move on :P [archive of an old and derpy RM2K3 game, mostly for close friends to download >.>]

WARNING: If you're crazy enough to get this, this download is around 700 MB large. I would recommend learning how to use a program like TortoiseGit to clone the repo to your computer and use the programs's "Pull" function to download it and future updates. 

Unlike NR and DV-DS, this is easily the largest repo in total size, and having to redownload 700 MB just to get a few updates that will usually be equal to at best a 3MB difference becomes very annoying. >.>
