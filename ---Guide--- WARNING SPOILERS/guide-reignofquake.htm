<p><font size="6">--- XIII. Bonus Game: The Reign of Quake ---</font></p>
<p>If you played through most of Chapter 1, you are aware of the idea that Tara, 
Plo, Bonnie, Marcus M., Joleena, Ness, Paula, Jeff, Poo, Rachel and Clyde all 
had one previous conflict with Quake, and you would have also seen a flashback 
of Tara sealing Quake in the Dead Zone. The events in this span of time are not 
perfectly described during DMA:UE, however if you manage to completely beat 
DMA:UE and get the true ending, it will also include a set of codes and a 
password, which both must be entered together[in otherwords, there will be no 
extended mode, alternate path mode, or cheater's mode], that will allow you to 
play &quot;The Reign of Quake&quot;, which is actually the ORIGINAL story of what 
happened, in game format. This was once an RM95 game long ago, and now it will 
be reborn. The game will have limits[level 25 is the highest any of the actually 
playable characters can go, since Tara's group is around 26-30 at the start of 
DMA:UE], and it will not likely be as long as DMA:UE itself. It's more meant as 
a bonus playable backstory. It will allow the player to gain a truer 
understanding of the nature of Tara and her friends' conflict with Quake, and 
why it's revealed he's such a threat in DMA:UE.</p>
