<p><font size="6">---- VI. Walkthrough ----</font></p>
<p><u><b><font size="5">Prologue:</font></b></u></p>
<p>When the game first starts, it will ask you to enter a confirmation code. 
This code is in a set of four NUMBERS, however you do not have to enter a code 
that actually works. The purpose of this is for in later games after beating 
DMA:UE once when you get codes to enter to change things. One code allows 
Alternate Paths to be selectable during the game, another allows the &quot;Extended 
Mode&quot;, which has various characters backstories develop at various points in the 
game[Marcus's will be right at the start, before gaining control over Don for 
the first time, if you use it]. Another code also allows you to have the 'I. 
Tracer' item from the start of the game, which detects items hidden on the 
ground[a transparent icon of the type of item appears on the square where the 
item is located when you have this]. There are 7 different codes available as of 
now:</p>
<p><b>9583</b> - I. Tracer Available<br>
<b>7585</b> - Alternate Route Mode<br>
<b>6589</b> - Alternate Route Mode (w/ I. Tracer)<br>
<b>4030</b> - Extended Mode<br>
<b>4210</b> - Extended Mode (w/ I. Tracer)<br>
<b>6341</b> - Alternate Routes and Extended Mode <br>
<b>7340</b> - Alternate Routes and Extended Mode (w/ I. Tracer) </p>
<p>Next thing that will happen is that the game will ask you for a password 'for 
extra goodies'. You will now have to enter a 21-digit password[in 3 sets of 7 
digits, that is], at least IF you want to enable other various modes, the main 
being the &quot;Cheaters Mode&quot;, which enables a menu option in the '0' key's menu to 
do various cheats. The code is '4846701-4841445-4527874' if you reallllllly 
wanna cheat. ;P</p>
<p>Now you'll be given the option to read the Introduction Story, or Skip it. 
New people NEED to read it at least once, despite how long it will be. If you're 
truly too lazy to read it, it basically documents on the 'Hexen Wars', a time 
over 1000 years ago when Magic was recently discovered on Cronos, and how three 
societies with total control over the world were created by the 'Grandmasters'. 
Also, it tells of Korax's coming, and his defeat, and of the aftermath, but I 
will not tell you all of it here. When the intro is done[or if you skipped it], 
you'll be asked to select the difficulty mode. You will be asked to choose a 
number between 1 to 4 for a difficulty level[0 and 5 also work for Very Easy and 
EXTREMELY Hard modes respectively]. After making your decision, Chapter 1, and 
Part 1 begins. By the way, the '0' key is your &quot;F1&quot; key in this game, as the key 
will bring up a menu with choices to view help, view your difficulty level and 
Map Coordinates, change the system graphics, or if cheat mode is on, an option 
to go into the cheats menu.</p>
<p><u><b><font size="5">=Chapter 1: Quake=</font></b></u></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Part 1: The Castle Saga</font></b></p>
<p><b><u>1. Don, Meet Marcus, Your New Friend!</u></b></p>
<p><u>1A. Meet Marcus! -</u> As the game starts, depending on your difficulty you'll 
start out with a different amount of coins. After Don jumps down from the cliff, 
you see a 'P' flashing in the upper part of the screen. After it's done 
flashing, a message will pop up telling you this is for your 'Objectives' menu, 
which is activated with the '+' key on the NumPad. The message will tell you 
exactly what each letter means: M means Mandatory[usually a Part-wide 
objective], P means Primary, S means Secondary, and T meaning Teritary[usually 
optional and not required to do]. Now, walk over to where the two trees and the 
cat are. He's blocking your path, so you can't walk around him. When you speak 
to him, he'll introduce himself as 'Marcus', a talking cat, sent by 'friends' to 
find Don to ask him to help him find a treasure in Janepo Ninja Castle to the 
east. Don accepts the job, having just left out on his own to make a life for 
himself[Don is 18], and Marcus gives him the 'Map Scroll' item. This can be used 
to check your position on various maps. It can be useful in some long dungeons 
in the later parts of the game. It's not the most useful on it's own though. 
However a remedy to that will be found soon enough. Take your new friend Marcus 
and continue east, and then upward. Under the tree here on the left side is a 
hidden item[healing related, difficulty based]. Now, if you go further up and a 
little to the left, you'll find a blue stone in the middle of some chairs and 
columns. If you're playing on Alternate Route mode, this stone can allow you to 
change the path. It'll ask you if you wish to break the stone. If you do, it'll 
cause it to rain for a good while over the area[you'll see how it alters the 
routes below]. If you leave it alone, you'll go on down the normal route. 
Proceed to the right to move on to the next area.</p>
<p><u>1B. Flaid the Puppy! -</u> Now you will enter an area where you are on a high 
ledge with a ladder going down to the ground below. At the bottom is both a 
small lake and a pair of waterfalls. Get on the boat, and go east, until you 
reach the other side, and see a girl with orange hair and pigtails walking back 
and forth. This is Helen, a friend of Don's since childhood[also 18 years old]. 
If you talk to her, she'll tell you that she knows you're off somewhere, and 
offers her 'Position Finder' that works with that handy map Marcus just gave 
you. Pay the cheap 10 coins[if you're on the highest two difficulties, it will 
be 25 coins, and you might have to fight once to get the coins for it first, but 
on Normal or easier levels, you should be able to get it with no problems]. 
She'll thank you and wish you luck on your journey. You'll now notice that 
you'll start getting into battles with various weak level creatures, like 
Slimes, Snakes, Spiders, and sometimes even bats. Unless you get back attacked 
or pincer attacked, these fights are easy, even with only two people. Personally 
though, I escape from the fights until I have four people, so they all level up 
and gain exp together, but you can work things in your own way here if you want. 
Now, continue down to the sign, and then when you touch the rocks nearby, Marcus 
will comment the direct path to Janepo Ninja Castle is blocked, and that you'll 
have to find another way. So head south, and then turn west. You'll notice an 
old man walking around at the base of the lake. This dude is actually a mobile 
shop that can sell you various items. Unfortunately, he is one of the rare few 
shops in the game that will not normally accept your items[unless you're on VERY 
Easy mode]. Now, continue down, until you reach a long fence, with a 
small-looking dog blocking the only way out. Before you do go to talk to him, go 
left and check the bush up along the fence for a hidden item[normally it'll be 
'Claw'-type weapons, depending on difficulty, unless on Very Hard and EXTREMELY 
Hard mode]. If you get 'Claw' items, they can be equipped on Marcus and the dog 
you're about to talk to. The Dog will introduce himself as Flaid, a two MONTH 
old puppy[although Don comments he is very mature-looking for his size], who was 
sent to find Don as his old master's last request. Flaid mentions he has the 
power to sense magical energies, and possibly use Magic itself, and that he is 
also very durable and hardy for his age[he has the most HP at the same level out 
of almost all characters in the game on average]. Flaid will also tell Don and 
Marcus that there is a cave to the east that can provide a fast way to the 
castle. Flaid will then join you, allowing you to proceed past the fence, and to 
the east. If you got at least two claw-type weapons, try to evenly distribute 
them among Marcus and Flaid, for Flaid has slightly weaker attack than Marcus, 
so he needs the claw[s].</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note:</b></font> <i>If you are playing on EXTREMELY 
Hard, Marcus will be found here instead of Flaid, and Flaid will be found in the 
caves ahead of you in 1C.</i></p>
<p><u>1C. Problems At the Castle -</u> Now that you've proceeded to the next area, 
you'll have a new monster group: 3 Slimes, 1 Ghost and 1 Snake. This group is 
worth around 106 EXP each, so when you feel like gaining EXP, this is your best 
group to get it, although the ghosts will start out faster than any of your 
people for a while. Going further east, you'll see the entrance to the cave. 
However, there is a Katana[Titanium Sword on VERY Easy] laying on the ground two 
tiles below the statue on the left side of the cave. Upon picking it up, Don can 
equip whatever sword he got. Equip it over his 'Thin Blade' for the best effect. 
His Thick Blade is stronger than the Thin Blade right now. Proceed up into the 
cave. Now, walk up, around the corner, then down, and then to the rocks. You can 
move the rocks by pushing on them when next to one. You should be able to figure 
this out on your own. If you can't, leave the cave to reset the rocks and try 
again. Be wary, there are some Ice Flames, and Willo-the-wisps in this cave that 
can attack you in addition to some of the other enemies I mentioned earlier. 
When you get past all the rocks, you can climb up the ladder nearby. However 
when you emerge out, you'll be confronted by guards[unless your on VERY Easy or 
Easy, where's there's just one guard]. You'll get kicked out of the castle, 
appearing by the rocks and the sign on the right side of the lake. Flaid will 
apologize, but Don says there's nothing Flaid could've done to know about the 
guards, and Marcus suggests they try to find another alternative way into the 
castle. From here, go back to the fence where you found Flaid, and walk past it. 
Don will notice something that wasn't there before, and walk over to it, 
revealing it's a stairway underground. When you go down, you'll emerge in a cave 
filled with water, and underground waterfalls in the background. There is a 
hidden item[KeroKeroCola] down and to the right[below the bridge, 6 squares 
below the right statue]. Go up the bridge and then the steps on the other side. 
You might remember an island in the middle of the lake with a pot on it. Well 
now you're on the island. Search the pot for items[Apples(+2 Max HP), TP 
Apples(+2 Max TP) and Phoenix Downs]. Do NOT use the apples yet, because you're 
about to get a fourth character in a few moments. Now go down the stairs on the 
right side of the island. You'll now be in a different part of the underground 
lake cave. You'll notice there are beds here, and a girl[or boy if you broke the 
Water Stone in Alternative Route mode] is standing on the edge on this area, 
near a rope.</p>
<p><u>[Normal Route] 1D. Mika The Ninja Princess -</u> Go down to the girl and speak to 
her, Don will ask if she might be the princess of the castle[she IS wearing a 
princess dress, although she lacks the crown]. She'll be confused of your lack 
of general knowledge, and Don and her will get into a conversation, where the 
girl becomes identified as Mika, who is in fact the legitimate princess of 
Janepo Ninja Castle. When asked why she is in this odd cave, she explains that a 
strange woman known as 'Lenako' arrived at the castle, acting as a friend, but 
in truth had evil intentions, using her wacked out mind-control power to possess 
the weaker soldiers and ninjas of the castle, gradually taking it over for 
herself. Mika and her best friend Jean tried to get away to find help, but Jean 
ended up staying behind to hold the possessed forces off to allow Mika to get 
away, and he is assumed to be captured, maybe even dead. Marcus them comments 
about it, causing Mika to get all surprised. Marcus and Flaid introduce 
themselves, explaining about the treasure said to be at the castle. Mika decides 
against her better judgment to join Don's group, now giving you a fourth 
member, and also some more money that Mika had taken with her. Now, go down the 
rope ahead of where she was, and flip the switch, which will make a bridge form 
to another high ledge with stairs on it. Going up these stairs will bring you to 
just past the lake on the east side[nearer to the sign and the rocks blocking 
the main path to Janepo Ninja Castle].</p>
<p><u>[Alternate Route] 1Da. Jean, the Apprentice Ninja</u> - Go down to the boy and 
speak to him. Don will ask him if he might be the prince of the castle. The boy 
replies that he is from the castle, or WAS. Don will then ask him if he knows 
why the guards are being aggressive. The boy will say you came at not so great 
of a time for them. Marcus insists he tells the group, to the boy's surprise. 
Marcus apologizes for startling Jean, and explains of the treasure he is sent 
for in the castle. The boy decides to tell Don the story about his turmoil, 
introducing himself as Jean. A strange woman named 'Lenako' came to their 
castle, acting as a friend, but in truth, had malicious intent, and used her 
magic to possess many of the ninjas and other royals of the castle. Jean and his 
teacher, and princess of the castle, Mika, had attempted to run away to find 
help, and Jean had been thinking to stay and hold off the Ninja, when a 
rainstorm snapped him out of his thoughts, and Mika decided to hold them off 
instead, telling Jean to escape. Mika was apparently captured, and possibly 
even being tortured, according to Jean. Flaid will be appalled with Lenako's 
actions, speaking up about it, also shocking Jean. Flaid will then introduce 
himself, and mentions Don to him. Jean then asks if Don's last name is Miguel, 
to which Don confirms. Jean tells you that he had a dream about him, Don, Mika 
and others that had formed an elite group of heroes. Jean realizes that it means 
they must be destined to fight against Lenako. Don agrees that Lenako needs to 
be taught to keep her mitts off other peoples' property, and Marcus wants 
everyone to help save Mika, and Jean aligns himself with the group, also giving 
you any money he had been carrying on him when he joins. Now, go down the rope 
ahead of where he was, and flip the switch, which will make a bridge form to 
another high ledge with stairs on it. Going up these stairs will bring you to 
just past the lake on the east side[nearer to the sign and the rocks blocking 
the main path to Janepo Ninja Castle].</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF"><b>Note:</b></font> <i>The reason that breaking the 
Water Stone causes Jean to be present instead of Mika is that the rainstorm it 
causes stops Jean from declaring he'll hold off the Ninjas for a short 
moment(like it broke his thoughts long enough that he was too late), allowing 
Mika to declare it first, thus Jean ends up escaping instead of Mika. If you 
have Extended Mode on, the game will go into this better and allow you to see 
what actually happens on either path.</i></p>
<p><u>1E. Breaking the Guards' Defenses -</u> Now that you're set to go, you'll notice 
one of the objectives says that if you bring Mika/Jean with you to the guards, 
they might respond, so basically, you must retrace your steps and go back 
through the cave. However, if you got any Apples and TP Apples from the pot on 
the island in the middle of the lake, it's time to evenly distribute them among 
all your characters. Now, rest yourself in the bed in the underground cave[the 
one next to where Mika/Jean was] to get a free recovery nap. Now, depending on 
the skill level, the guards you saw earlier, and will see soon will vary. On 
Very Easy and Easy skill, there's a single Red Male Guard, however on Very Easy, 
you get a Surround Attack on him, meaning you can be at the bare minimum of 
level 1 to beat him. You can probably beat him on Easy without the Surround 
Attack at Level 1 as well. On Normal mode, you'll have a Male Red Guard and a 
Male Blue Guard to deal with. You MIGHT want to be at least Level 2, as the Blue 
guards have strong armor that reduces damage from most physical attacks, not to 
mention Sleep Kick, which puts one person to sleep and does some damage. On 
Hard, you'll have one Red Male Guard, one Blue Male Guard, and one Red Female 
Guard to deal with. You'll likely want to be level 2 for this, as the Female 
Guard is faster than the others, and has the ability of a Double Attack. On Very 
Hard, you'll deal with the same group, except they start off with YOU in a 
Pincer Attack, allowing them a free turn on you. You should be Level 3 at least 
for this, as they also have some attacks that they only use on the Harder skills 
available to them. On EXTREMELY Hard, you deal with the same group, plus a Male 
Ninja that leads them all. Again, they get a Pincer Attack on you, so you'll 
likely want to be Level 4 or even 5 before this fight, and have some Phoenix 
Downs in addition if you can, as the Ninja in himself is a difficult enemy with 
Flame Field attacks that hit the whole group at once[although Marcus is immune 
to the fire, so he'll get lucky]. When you defeat them, they'll vanish, and a 
rope will appear, allowing the group to scale the outereast wall and get into 
the Castle!</p>
<p><u><b>2. Break into The Castle!</b></u></p>
<p><u>2A. Preparations for the Siege -</u> On the east wall, descend the stairs, and 
pick up the Safe Tea Boots in the room near you. They allows one character to be 
immune to hazardous terrain[lava, poison swamp, etc]. However they won't be 
likely used right now. You'll also notice a &quot;Star of David&quot; icon on the right 
side of the room. Walking into the center of it, you'll get a tip that walking 
into the center of these circles will fully heal the party. It's usually a good 
call that if you're underleveled, to hang around one of these and fight suitable 
enemies until you're strong enough, healing after each round. Remember, you can 
save at ANY place you want in the game, so you can heal, save, and then try to 
fight. If it doesn't go in your favor, you can end game or hit F12 and reload 
your game and try again. Back on subject though: if you walk around in here, you 
can sometimes fight pairs of guards[one Red Male, and one Blue Male]. They're 
worth around 80 EXP, so they can be of some use, since they're one of the less 
powerful guard combinations you'll see in this castle, unless they ambush or 
surround you. Exit the room through the door, and you'll be back on the outside 
of the castle. In the upper left bush next to your position, there is a helmet 
of somekind hidden in it[3 Iron Helmets on Very Easy, 1 Iron Helmet on Easy, 1 
Steel Helmet on Normal, 1 Heavy Helmet on Hard, 2 Light Helmets on Very Hard, 1 
Light Helmet on EXTREMELY Hard] I usually give the first/only helmet to Marcus, 
since his defense is the weakest of the four heroes at this point. Now, walk up 
on the right side of the building on the right and check the bush for an item of 
various types[Apples on Easier levels, Phoenix Downs on Normal, Omniantidotes on 
Hard, and Antidotes on the harder skill levels]. </p>
<p>If you go into the Inn, Flaid will get a scare from the innkeeper, but other 
than that, it's a different amount of money per person to stay, depending on the 
skill level. Now, there is a special note on this place. If you sleep here 50 
times[20 on Very Easy], the Innkeeper will be so pleased that she'll allow you 
to take the contents of the chest on her left, and will open the table for you. 
In here is a whole bunch of stuff that can easily help you out. If you talk to 
her while behind the table, she'll jump over you and let you past her. Go to the 
furnace and check it for a Regen2 Sigil[Regen3 Sigil on Very Easy]. These items 
can tremendously help you out if you're willing to take the time to stay 20-50 
times. To leave, talk to her again, and she'll jump back into her seat and let 
you pass. Now, the other building is a shop. However before you go in, check the 
bushes outside of the shop, for Scouters[as many as 1 to 96 depending on the 
skill level]. Also, going into the room down here, and open the chest for a 
Spiked Knuckle Don, Mika and Jean can equip, but preferably Mika or Jean should 
equip this]. If you're on Easy or VERY Easy, go up the steps to find a chest on 
the left wall. Inside you'll get a few pocket shelters[full recovery items, 
unusable in battles], and if on VERY Easy, some stat increasing items you should 
evenly distribute between members. Also, do note that the rocks blocking your 
entry to the castle from the waterfalls are gone, and you can go in/out that way 
now. Also, if you flip the switch out here next to the door, it'll open the 
castle door, giving you a quick way in and out without having to go up and down 
the right wall all the time.</p>
<p>Go into the shop now and talk to the shopkeeper. What he sells is dependant 
on difficulty level. On VERY Easy, getting Dragon Helmets for Don, Marcus and 
Flaid[and Jean if he's with you], getting a Talisman Ribbon for Mika, a Kevlar 
Dress for Mika, and Iron Armor for Don, Marcus, Flaid[and Jean if he's with you] 
are preferred Armors. Shurikens for Jean/Mika are also recommended. On Easy, Iron 
Helmets are preferred for Don, Marcus and Flaid[and Jean if he's with you], 
Steel Armor for Don, Marcus, Flaid[and Jean], Defense Ribbon for Mika, and Thick 
Dress for Mika are preferred Armor. One Crossbow for Mika/Jean can work too. On 
Normal, Defense Ribbon and Thick Dress for Mika, and Heavy Armor and Steel 
Helmets for Don, Marcus, Flaid[and Jean] are preferred armor. On Hard, Steel 
Helmets and Light Armor for Don, Marcus, Flaid[and Jean], and Light Dress and 
Defense Ribbon for Mika are preferred armors. On Very Hard, Heavy Helmets and 
Leather Armor for Don, Marcus, Flaid[and Jean], and Light Dress and Red Ribbon 
are preferred armors. On EXTREMELY Hard, the same armor set up is preferred. 
Also, in addition, buy any side items[Potions, Antidotes and Phoenix Downs are 
the most recommended to stock up on first], and then, once you are ready to 
proceed, leave the store, and head north to find the main entrance into the 
castle. </p>
<p><u><b>3. The Castle of the Ninjas</b></u></p>
<p><u>3A. Maze of Switches -</u> In this area, you'll notice there are a lot of walls 
blocking various paths. The center of this area has a wall with a furnace on it, 
however if you check the bags in this area, you can find a Crossbow and then 
Mind-Ups. Give the Crossbow to Jean or Mika if they don't already have one. Now 
proceed back down to near the entrance. Go right and move along the path until 
you reach a section with a switch on the wall near you. Flip it to make one of 
the walls nearby vanish, as well as the left wall in the center of this area. 
Also, there's some Phoenix Downs on the ground in this area you can pick up if 
you look in the right place. Go past the wall that just vanished and collect the 
Defensive-ups in the chest, and flip the switch here to remove the wall on the 
left near the entrance[the opposite side of the way you originally came in to 
get here]. Go back and take that path and proceed up the many sets of stairs, 
until the path leads you to a lever-switch. If you're playing on Normal skill or 
higher, you will have to fight to reach it. On Normal, 3 Cacodemons guard it, on 
Hard, 4 guard it. On Very Hard, 3 Barons of Hell guard it, and on EXTREMELY 
Hard, 4 Barons will guard it. You should be at least level 4-5 before trying to 
fight them. Once they are gone, flip the lever, and it will remove the wall 
blocking the exit to the next area, and it will remove the north wall in the 
central section of the room, allowing you to reach the brown chest that's there, 
as well as the lever. Go back to that switch, and flip it to remove both the 
right wall in the center section of the room, and to remove another wall 
blocking Red Chests that you saw earlier going for the first switch. There are 
Ninjas in the Brown Chest, so be wary when you open it. However in addition, 
there's a good abundance of coins, and Shurikens[2-hit weapon for Mika/Jean] 
that you can take. In the Red Chests, there are Crystal Vials, Quartz Flasks, 
Discs of Repulsion, and Chaos Devices to take. It's recommended as well that you 
be level 5+ before going on to the next area. As for monster encounters here, 
you'll deal with a wide variety of guard groups, consisting of Red Male Guards, 
Female Red Guards and Blue Guards. Their numbers per battle vary, so be careful 
not to be ambushed or surrounded by a large group of guards on a low level. 
Finally, near the exit of this area, you'll notice an area up on a ledge above 
where you can't reach. If you press the burning torch here[the one that's 
glowing], you'll summon a rope to climb up to that area. A few blocks above the 
rope is a Big Axe on the ground, which Don can use. Also, the chest has 
Attack-ups which can be given to your characters. </p>
<p><u>3B. Center of The Fray! -</u> As you enter this area, you'll see another star on 
the ground. If you feel you're in danger of being owned, try to reach the center 
of the star without getting into a battle. The battles here are more difficult 
than in the last area, so my strategy of 'heal, save, fight, repeat' can be of 
much use here. Hover around the star and fight until you're around level 9-12 
before you venture too far away from the star again. The battles here consist of 
a light-blue variant of both the original blue guards and the Female Red Guards. 
These 'Knights' are a good deal stronger than the common guard, and they can 
appear in groups of 1 to 4 each. The Female knights can use Cure, which cheaply 
recovers 200+ of her and each of her allies' HP, making them very annoying, and 
your first priority to get rid of when they're around. The male knights can 
mainly just use a double attack or a stronger Flame Field than the Ninjas you 
faced earlier, but he can't heal himself, so he's much less annoying in the long 
run. Other enemies in this area are Male and Female Ninjas. Female Ninjas use 
Snow Storm on your party, the Ice variant of Flame Field, and this CAN hurt 
Marcus a lot. In fact, it hurts Marcus and Mika the most out of all of your 
characters, so watch their health in battles against Female Ninjas. Another 
monster you can fight here is the 'Heavy Guard'. These characters look like 
muscular, bearded guards[with pirate-like bandanas on their heads]. These little 
buttheads are deceptively fast[faster than NINJAS even o_O], and can deal 
devastating damage even with their common attacks[they can Double attack AND 
they do critical hits a lot more often]. Their Body Blow attack can also do a 
lot of damage and shock one character for a turn. They do drop Big Axes when 
they are defeated, which Don can equip as better weapons. The last two enemies 
you can meet here are rare, and potentially lethal. The G'anari Daemonite[Baron 
of Hell-like creature with a Shield] and the Archon of Hell[Baron of Hell-like 
creature with fire around his feet and striped body] are powerful 'random 
mini-boss' like foes. The Daemonites have 3500 HP and the Archons have 8000 HP, 
however they appear alone, never with others of either type to help them. 
However both have the potential to wipe out a weak party unless you have a lot 
of luck. One of the best ways of beating them at weak levels is to have Don use 
'Ultra Poison' on them. Both demons can be given H. Poison, which is a much 
worse form of the normal Poison ailment. This makes the Archon lose almost 1000 
HP per turn in addition to whatever damage you do to him if he has this ailment. 
As for weaknesses, both demons hate Ice, Thunder and Holy attacks, especially 
level 2-3 spells of these elements. Archons will give over 3250 EXP when you 
beat them, and Daemonites around 1625 EXP, plus Daemonites will usually drop 
Dragon Claws[weapons for Marcus and Flaid, much stronger than Bear Claws], while 
Archons will usually drop Titanium Swords[stronger than Big Axes], so you might 
want to make it a personal objective to get 2 Titanium Swords and 4 pairs of 
Dragon Claws to maximize Don, Marcus and Flaid's effectiveness in physical 
combat. Either way, beating these two demons can quickly increase your levels to 
what you need to proceed.</p>
<p>Now that you are sufficiently leveled, proceed east, noting any possible 
chests that might appear nearby due to difficulty levels. You will reach an area 
with many columns, and a sign behind one, and a wall that looks like it should 
have something on it. Go read the sign, and Jean/Mika will explain that the 
control crystal that activates the door to the throne room[for protection and 
security reasons] has been shut off and that you must proceed southward to find 
the means to reactivate it. However, before you completely leave the area, note 
there are some hidden TP apples two squares below one of the upper left columns 
in this area you should give to Marcus[remember, he has very low TP early in the 
game, so these can really help him]. Now, head down the south passage from the 
star, and go right until you reach the clock. Checking the clock will give you 
random benefits, from Money, Armor, Weapons, or even some Level ups. The best 
overall thing to get is the 'Malak Shard' if it were to come up. This item is 
both able to increase all of one person's stats[sans HP/TP] by FIFTY points, or 
it can be sold for 499999 coins each[which is a lot at this point in the game]. 
Proceed down, and walk to the edge of the chasm. Mika/Jean will comment that the 
dungeon, along with the crystal is over the chasm, and that only they can jump 
the gap and must proceed alone to the crystal. They will then make a running 
jump over[although if Jean is there he'll almost not make it, but pull himself 
up]. Now, head down the stairs[you can't go back until you accomplished this 
mission, so don't bother trying to jump back].</p>
<p></p>
<p><u><b>4. Dungeon of Doom</b></u></p>
<p><u>4A. Depths of the Dungeon -</u> Be VERY weary down here. You have only ONE 
character right now, so the battles here can be either way. Also, I always 
avoid/escape battles until I regroup with the other characters in this part, so 
all of them still level up together, but again, you can handle this in anyway 
you want. Also, pay attention to WHAT part in the dungeon you're in, because the 
monster groups also vary depending on the area. In the red area, for enemy 
analysis, there are Cacodemons here, appearing alone, in pairs, or in 
trios[they're likely gonna be faster than either Mika or Jean at this point by a 
small amount. Mika is still faster in combat than Jean, so she stands the 
greatest chance, especially with Shurikens equipped]. Barons of Hell also run 
around down here, alone or sometimes in pairs. They're a lot more durable, but 
not as fast as Cacodemons, however they can increase their attack and 
defense[and on Harder skills, they can lower your party's attack and defense in 
addition]. In the icy part of the dungeon, you have Cacodemons, Barons of Hell, 
Big Snakes[hydra-looking snakes, easy for even single level 2 people to kill], 
and even CYBERDEMONS lurk here. In the grayish-brown area, various guards and 
ninjas will attack you, which are easier than most of the enemies in here, but 
still be weary.</p>
<p>From the steps, you should go down to where the push button switch and the 
two brown chests are. Don't touch the Brown Chests yet. I recommend getting the 
rest of the party back before doing this, but do hit the switch. If you notice, 
in the middle of this area, there are four separate walls blocking various 
paths. The switch you hit just removed the southern wall of these four, allowing 
you later access to the south part of the dungeon. [WARNING: on EXTREMELY Hard 
there are Archons and Daemonites behind the walls that will be freed to chase 
you once these walls are removed!] Now, proceed north and then east, until you 
reach the icy area. You have to move through this area to reach another push 
switch. There are also ropes on the walls here[and sometimes Cyberdemons are 
waiting at the top of them, depending on the difficulty level]. Be careful not 
to be caught by a group with Cyberdemons, especially a group with TWO, because 
the chances are, you'll get owned before you can even run away at this point. 
When you finally accomplish that task, leave the icy area and go back south to 
where all the walls are. You'll notice only one wall remains to take down, as 
well as a star to heal at, and now you can enter the grayish-brown area. Proceed 
through here with caution of the monster parties here. There is a switch on the 
floor at the end[and some areas you can't reach for a long while[you'll be able 
to later in the game]. Walk on the switch to press it, which removes the final 
wall. Go back there, and you'll see a ladder, and a sign telling you the crystal 
room is just above. In this small room, you'll notice a sword glowing and 
floating in the air, as well as a crystal in the center left part of the area. 
When you attempt to go into the area, Mika/Jean will automactially acknowledge 
the sword, but will not recognize it as anything of theirs. She/he tries to grab 
the sword, but a forcefield blasts her/him back. She/he decides she/he will tell 
Don and Marcus about it later. Sadly, proceed to the crystal and push it. You'll 
get a view of the doorway to the throneroom opening, with some bell sounds 
accompanying it. Once you're back in control again, quickly make your way back 
out of the dungeon. A bridge has now formed over the chasm, walk over it and 
talk to either Don, Marcus or Flaid, and they rejoin, and you'll have four 
people again. Now it's best recommended to go back down in the dungeon to level 
everyone up to a respectable level.</p>
<p><u>4B. Tricks and Traps -</u> IMMEDIATELY go to the Brown Chests. The lower chest is 
the easiest one to beat, so take it first. A Cacodemon will attack you first, 
then you'll get a Soul Blade, and then a Baron will attack you, and you'll get a 
Quad Damage MK. II. However, another bell and hint pop up, telling you about 
'Clerk Demons', which are shop-running creatures that sometimes pop up in Brown 
Chests after all the evil has been purged from them. This particular demon has a 
varying arsenal of items, among the more important items are KeroKeroColas and 
Pocket Shelters. Also, you can sell him any access Katanas and stuff you have to 
help your inventory out. You can revisit this shop at any time after this, so 
you don't have to immediately buy everything you need. The upper brown chest 
will have some Ninjas in it that attack you, then some money, then a suit of 
Armadillo Armor that should be given to Marcus, and then it will ask if you 
really want to open the chest any further. Saying yes will make a Cyberdemon 
jump out[two on Very Hard and THREE on EXTREMELY Hard], and you'll get into a 
boss-like battle with it/them. They yield Apples when they die, not to mention a 
good jump in exp[about 3125 EXP each], so you'll likely level up here. 
Cyberdemons are weakest to Ice and Holy[but Ice is most effective]. Also, beware 
of them attacking Don with Rockets, since he is weak to the 'Missile' element, 
which Rockets happen to be. A Big Rocket to Don is an almost guaranteed KO, so 
have Phoenix Downs on hand just in case. When you win this battle, you'll also 
have a good idea how to deal with other Cyberdemons, as well as receiving Soul 
Spheres[8 on Very Easy, 4 on Easy, 3 on Normal, 2 on Hard, SIX on Very Hard and 
TWELVE on EXTREMELY Hard(which is opposite of normal)], and you should then go 
back to the icy area, and try to fight Cyberdemons[or you can also fight the 
ones at the top of the ropes. Also, if you climb the ropes, you'll notice an 
exit that wasn't there before. Taking this exit will actually put you back in 
the Underground water cave. However, go one space left from where you came out, 
and you'll find a suit of Diamond Armor on the ground. Replace Marcus's 
Armadillo Armor with this, and give the Armadillo Armor to Flaid or Don, whoever 
you choose. You CAN go back to the bed in the cave and heal for free before 
going back into the Castle Dungeon again, so if you're hurt, take that 
opportunity, then go back. As for level requirements, a single Cyberdemon 
recommends at least level 10-15 for fighting them, and two or more at least 
11-16. Level 15-22 is recommended to get everyone to before proceeding forward 
into the plot. When you feel you're sufficient enough to go on, leave the dungeon 
and head to the newly made passage to the throneroom. Finally, one final item 
rests on the ground in the dungeon. Near the ladder to the control room, there 
are some rocks. Search around them to find a BFG9K item on the ground[usuable by 
a later character], just so you have it on you.</p>
<p><u><b>5. The Final Stretch</b></u></p>
<p><u>5A. The Gauntlet of Lenako -</u> This next area is primary a lot of battles, and 
a good deal of plot. The first thing you'll usually deal with[unless on Very 
Easy skill] are a varying number of Ninjas. On Very Hard and EXTREMELY hard 
mode, you'll also be dealing with Elite Ninjettes, which are the strongest 
variant of Ninja, and are resistant to almost all elements and capable of using 
Furea on you. They drop Titanium Armor when they die though. However they can be 
very tough on a less experienced party. After dropping them, you'll have more 
immediate trouble if you're playing on any skill except for EXTREMELY Hard 
mode[however that doesn't mean it's any better off in the long run on this 
skill]. The next character you'll face is dependant on who's path you've taken. 
Normally you'll take Mika's path, so you'll fight Metalman in combat, who is 
actually revealed to be a brainwashed and semi-transformed Jean. After MIKA 
takes about 6 turns in combat, she'll use something to revert him back to normal 
state of mind and form. If you take Jean's path, you'll fight the Evil 
Priestess, who is actually Mika brainwashed and enchanted with extra powers. 
After JEAN takes 6 turns in combat, he'll use something to revert her back to 
normal. Out of both possible battles, the Evil Priestess is slightly more 
difficult because of her speed altering powers.</p>
<p>Either way, the next enemy you deal with automatically attacks you after the 
battle with Jean/Mika's transformed state, and you can't heal or save between 
this either, so be especially cautious if you were weakened by the last fight. A 
robot known as Shadowman appears and attacks the person you just defeated. If 
you're on Jean's path, he'll attack Shadowman back for hurting Mika and get 
between them, causing the battle to start. On Mika's path, you'll just jump 
between Shadowman and Jean, starting the battle. The battle with Shadowman has 
different outcomes here depending on who you're using. On Jean's path, they'll 
banter a little, and Shadowman will get a lead off attack on all four members, 
doing a decent amount of damage. On Mika's path, you'll immediately begin the 
battle. Shadowman is faster than Metalman/Evil Priestess, so you'll likely not 
be able to get the first move on him. He tends to favor throwing his Shadow 
Blades and using his Shadow Slide[one of his most dangerous moves, able to shock 
the entire party and possibly give him a free move]. When you get nearer to the 
end of the fight, the battle will end differently depending on who you're using. 
If you're using Mika, nothing special happens, and the battle will conclude 
normally. If using Jean though, Shadowman taunts you and uses a spell called 
'Stoppura'[Stop to all members] to try to freeze the group in time, but Jean 
resists the spell out of his fierce anger at Shadowman, and slashes the hell out 
of him, and then finishes it off with a spell known as Faira[Fire 2 for you FF 
vets], which the combo in the long run does over 10,000 damage to Shadowman, 
obliterating him. After the battle ends, Mika/Jean will check on Jean/Mika, and 
the latter will confirm they'll be okay in the long run, urging the former to go 
and defeat Lenako. Various characters learn various moves from this battle. Don 
can learn Shadow Blade, Shadow Slide, Marcus can learn Metal Blade, Metal Blade 
Omega, Shadow Blade, Shadow Blade Omega, Mika can learn Metal Blade and Shadow 
Blade, and Jean can learn Afterimage and Barrier[he also learns Faia and Faira 
in addition, even though it's not mentioned](a bonus to the player for taking 
Jean's alternate path that can help make the game easier for a time). You will 
also win the Shadow Blade WEAPON for Mika or Jean to use, which can be thrown 
two or three times per attack. This should replace whatever is NOT your 
Shurikens[allowing Mika/Jean to attack at least four times a turn]. Now you'll 
be able to go after Lenako herself. However, it's best to heal on the star and 
save first. Also, checking the armor suit on the most left can give you Storm 
Claws[Marcus and Flaid can use], Bronze Armor, or KeroKeroColas. At the right 
table further ahead, walk between the middle and lowest occupants[they vary 
depending on the skill level, or there's none at all on Very Easy] to find 5 Big 
Bottle Rockets[they're like the same kind the Cyberdemons use, but a later 
character can use them as items]. Also, check the clock on the left for either 
Capsules, Kraters of Might, a Saturn Ribbon, or Quad Damage MK IIs. Finally, on 
EXTREMELY Hard Mode, there is a Brown Chest that appears in the lower right 
corner of the room[it will not appear on easier skill levels]. In it are three 
Cyberdemons, coins, FOUR Daemonites and FOUR Archons[as a single party O_O], and 
then you'll meet this strange zombie guy named 'Butan'*, who doubles as a Clerk 
Demon. Among his inventory are Chaos Devices, Discs of Repulsion, Kevlar 
Dresses, Talisman Ribbons, and other stuff. Also, if you buy something from him, 
he'll give you a Regen Sigil the first time. Otherwise he'll just thank you for 
shopping.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Note:</b></font> <i>'Butan' is a character from a 
later demo of the original DMA, a zombie character you had to fight and then 
gained as an ally. I decided to pay my homage to him by making him appear in a 
special Brown Chest that appears earlier on harder skill levels.</i></p>
<p>When you're ready to confront Lenako, walk up just in between both thrones. A 
cutscene occurs where Lenako reveals herself, as well as a dark-skinned, 
elven-looking man, who Mika/Jean had never seen before. If you have Mika, she 
and Lenako will banter a little. If Jean is there, Lenako will try to woo him 
into joining her[she has some crazy lust for him or something, hence why in 
Mika's path he was so valued to her]. Don will ask the man who he is. He will 
introduce himself as 'Zarbon', saying he is ally to Lenako. Mika/Jean will 
berate him and Lenako, vowing to stop them. Marcus then has a revelation about 
Lenako, telling you about the 'Jikuba', the demons and other creatures you met in 
the dungeons, and how she is part of them. Lenako is impressed with Marcus's 
knowledge, correcting him and telling him she is the leader of the group, and 
not just a minion. She then jumps over behind you, summoning her minions[the 
occupants at the table] to flank her. These minions will vary depending on the 
skill level. If you're on VERY Easy, she has no reinforcements. On Easy, she has 
only lower Red Male, Red Female and Blue Male Guards flanking her[2 of each 
type]. On Normal, she'll have three Male and three Female Ninjas helping her. On 
Hard, she has two Cacodemons, two Barons of Hell and Two Cyberdemons flanking 
her. On Very Hard she has FOUR CyberDemons, and two Elite Ninjettes helping her. 
And on EXTREMELY Hard, she has FOUR Elite Ninjettes flanking her, and in 
addition, Metalman/Evil Priestess and Shadowman will teleport in and join in the 
melee[I told you that it wasn't any better in the long run], and this is by far 
the most difficult group to deal with.</p>
<p>Lenako will not be simple, even on Very Easy. She is the first enemy whose 
stats vary between difficulty levels[meaning she has stronger attack, defense, 
speed, resistances, etc on high skills, and less on low skills]. On the hardest 
skills, her minions can pose a direct threat to you, and on EXTREMELY Hard, 
you've got Elite Ninjettes and Shadowman and Metalman/Evil Priestess to deal 
with. Not to mention Lenako knows a mix of Magic abilities, but also seems to 
have PK skills. Be especially careful of PK Freeze if Mika is present, as she is 
weaker to it than the others. Also, when she gets very weak, beware of her PK 
Dynamo attack, especially if she pulls a Beta level on you, since it can 
basically wipe out most of your group. Once she is finally defeated, she'll 
apologize to Zarbon about dying, and well... she dies... -_-; Anyways, Zarbon 
will get mighty pissy with you and after some banter from Mika/Jean, he vows he 
will not allow you to get in the way of his 'vengeance'. For some reason, there's 
the odd feeling he's not necessarily talking about YOU when he says that... 
However either way, he'll teleport out in spheres of light with his tail between 
his legs. Now, you'll congratulate each other, and Mika/Jean will bring up the 
sword she/he found in the control room of the dungeon, suggesting it might be 
the treasure Marcus seeks. However she/he decides to check on Jean/Mika first[if 
you played on EXTREMELY Hard skill, Jean/Mika will be closer to the throne than 
on the other skill levels, so this will go by faster]. Jean/Mika will ask 
Mika/Jean and the group to try to get that sword, and that he/she'll wait for 
her where they are, and that they'll be okay. A final note is that if Don has 
both Titanium Swords equipped at this point, you'll all get bonus EXP[50,000 on 
Very Easy, 20,000 on Easy, 16,000 on Normal, 12,000 on Hard, 8,000 on Very Hard 
and 4,000 on EXTREMELY Hard]. If you have 4 Dragon Claws equipped on Marcus and 
Flaid, all characters[including future characters] will get a bonus increase to 
HP[On VERY Easy, they get 50 HP, 50 TP, 10 Attack, 10 Defense, 10 Mind and 10 
Agility as well], money, and even items on easier skills[Bubsy Claws and Muscle 
Sigils].</p>
<p><u><b>6. The Mysterious Sword</b></u></p>
<p><u>6A. The Magic Field -</u> Return back to the sword in the central crystal room of 
the dungeon, taking note of the Brown Chest that has appeared here. There are 
various groups of demons inside, as well as Claw weapons of various types, 
opening it further fully heals your group, and again pits you against more 
demons[as well as Marcus/Flaid memorizing the area to quickly teleport to it], 
and also you'll get Power-Ups and Defense-Ups[except on EXTREMELY Hard, where 
you get 10 Miracle Drops instead]. There is also a Clerk Demon inside of this 
chest. Note the Plasma Rifle that he sells can be useful for a few later 
characters as a permanent usable item. Also, get Mika/Jean at least ONE Ninja 
Sword if he has them[all but EXTREMELY Hard skill], because the sword allows 
them to get a personal preemptive strike[they go first regardless of their speed 
in combat]. You'll also notice 'Diablo Claws', 'Storm Claws' and 'Glacier 
Claws'. These are special elemental Claws that can be equipped on Marcus and 
Flaid. Each one combines two elemental properties. Diablo Claws are Dark/Fire, 
Storm Claws are Wind/Thunder, and Glacier Claws are Ice/Earth. He might also 
have Holy Water Claws[stronger attack than the other elemental claws, Holy/Water 
elemental] to sell you. He can also sell Soul Spheres[+50 HP/TP] and Mega 
Spheres [+25 HP/TP, +10 Attack, Defense, Mind, Speed], but they are expensive. 
On Normal, he sells Saturn Ribbons and Scouters, and also Multi Bottle 
Rockets[stronger than Big ones]. On Easy, he sells Royal Dresses, Goddess 
Ribbons, Regen Sigils[though they cost 750,000 coins], Ninja Stars[stronger 
versions of the Shurikens], Dragon Helmets and Titanium Armor. On VERY Easy, he 
sells BFG10K[a stronger BFG9K, same characters can use as the older one], also 
stat-raising Capsules, Super Shotguns[another reusable item for later 
characters], V, I, M and AB-Stims[the latter is full recovery plus temporary 
regeneration for one ally], and also various medikits. After buying what you 
need, walk over and examine the sword. Marcus will realize this IS likely the 
treasure and Don tries to pull it out, but like Mika/Jean, is repelled by a 
magic barrier. Flaid examines the barrier with his magic senses, and realizes 
it's strong enough to keep it safe from Zarbon, who you now believe came with 
Lenako for the sword in the first place. However Flaid suggests you get back to 
Jean/Mika and get them to a place to recover. So go back to the throneroom and 
find Jean/Mika, who will now have gotten to their feet. Talk to him/her, and 
Marcus will teleport you all to the underground water cave, where Jean/Mika will 
be now lying in the upper bed on the ledge. Some dialogue occurs and Don and 
Mika/Jean vow to Jean/Mika that they'll find Zarbon and put a stop to him, and 
Part 1 ends, transitioning to Part 2.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Part 2: Who is Zarbon?</font></b></p>
<p><b><u>1. The Strange Girl with the Piano</u></b></p>
<p><u>1A. The Legendary Weapon -</u> Part 2 will now begin, and you will find yourself 
just outside the waterfalls. You'll see Helen nearby, and she'll ask you if 
anything new has been going on. Mika/Jean ask her if she could watch Jean/Mika 
down in the cave, since you all have to try to find Zarbon's whereabouts. Helen 
accepts, having nothing else to do, and drops you a small hint before she goes 
down to the cave: someone has moved into the lower cliffs, below where you began 
the game, and that a ladder from the top to the bottom of the cliffs has formed. 
When she leaves, you can go over to your west and check at the water's edge 
where it looks like towers are starting to rise out of the water. Flaid will 
mention this was some old castle that sunk over 100 years ago, and Mika/Jean 
believe Zarbon's presence is the cause of it's rising. However this is not 
important yet, so go find where you left your boat, and use it to cross over 
back to the north side of the lake, and go back to the cliffs. There is an open 
path to another area to the left, but you won't go far at this point by going 
that way, so just head to the cliffs, and go down the ladder.</p>
<p>Now you'll find yourself in a new area, and it's quite open and spacey. When 
you get off the ladder, bells will ring out of nowhere, and another hint pops 
up, telling you about items that are possibly hidden on the ground, and that a 
Soul Sphere is on the ground somewhere. If you climb up the rope on your left, 
there are 4 Scouters on the ground up there somewhere as well. The Soul Sphere 
is on the right side of this area, before the little pool of water with the 
strange girl and the piano on it. Speaking of which, when you finish, go and 
talk to the girl. She will comment about the loveliness of the area, and then 
she'll tell you she found this strange sword and she has no clue of what it is, 
but she'll just give it to you. However, unbeknownst to her, she has just given 
you a legendary weapon of old, the QUIETUS[the runesword weapon Baratus used in 
the Hexen wars(the fighter's fourth weapon in Hexen)]. Don will be able to equip 
this, and it can attack three times against enemies. Also, you will notice 
another ladder south of you that goes down to a small pier-like area. This is 
the same place you'll end up if you take the left path on the lake. Now that 
you've been to the cliff, you can use the boat to go here as a shortcut if you 
don't want to go up the cliff and back down to get here, so keep that in mind, 
but since you wouldn't have come here that way the first time, you have to go 
back up the ladder and down the ledge at the waterfalls to get to the boat.</p>
<p>Now go back to the underground water cave. If you want, talk to Helen and 
Jean/Mika for the sake of it. Nothing much will come from it, though. This is 
where some people might get confused and think they've hit a dead end, because 
this part isn't perfectly specified in the game. You need to now walk onto the 
same space Mika/Jean was standing on when you first met them. When this happens, 
the screen glows green, Don glows green, then the statues of gargoyles in the 
water down and to your left begin to crackle with energy. Flaid mentions he 
senses the Quietus is reacting with the statues, and tells you to check it out, 
so do so. When you check one of the statues, Don will use the Quietus to smash 
the statues, and their destructions opens a small portal entrance that you can 
walk though to the next part.</p>
<p><b><u>2. The Flooded Barbican</u></b></p>
<p><u>2A. High Water -</u> You'll now find yourself in a strange castle like structure, 
but there is water covering almost the entire area here. You can walk through 
the water though, so trek around and explore. If you wish to speed up your trip 
here, just go northwards along the path, until you reach a large room, which has 
a wall with a rope hanging half way down the wall, and also a switch on the 
wall. Flip the switch and you'll then realize the water has drained a good deal. 
Most of it is gone, but most of it is still somewhat present. You'll also notice 
a pointer blinking an arrow at one of the bookcases here, but ignore it for now. 
Go back south, and then go further south and then east, to find an area with 
what looks like a slight opening. Don mentions he can't fit in there, but Marcus 
and Flaid declare they can. This means to go on, only Marcus and Flaid may 
continue on. As for fights in this area, the high-water area has Golems, and the 
low-water area has Cacodemons, Barons and Cyberdemons. Nothing really new though 
in terms of enemies. Take Marcus and Flaid into the next area, which is more 
like a flooded maze. The end of this maze is towards the middle top, but you'll 
mostly have to go right and then up to get to it. Flip the switch on the end, 
and most of the water here drains as well. Make your way back to the exit. Be 
careful in here, you can be attacked by Daemonites and Archons, although this is 
good for leveling up too. Leave this area and remeet with Don and Mika/Jean and 
talk to one of them to rejoin with them. </p>
<p><u>2B. Ghostly Problems -</u> Now, it's best suggested to be around level 35+ before 
going too far back north. Head back to the first large room with the rope and 
the switch. As you attempt to reach it, you'll see transparent Cyberdemons 
blocking your way[unless on VERY Easy, where there are none]. Do not assume this 
will be an easy fight. These are actually GHOST Cyberdemons, which take double 
the damage, and are more resistant to elements, and not to mention they can hit 
characters with a nasty BFG9K blast when greatly weakened, which almost always 
KOes anyone who's not named Flaid in one hit[Flaid is resistant to Typeless, 
which BFGs are, so he takes half damage and can usually survive a hit at full 
health]. Draining attacks are your best offense against these creatures, 
although Antipodes, Kienzans and other Typeless-elemental skills work too. Once 
they are gone, you can proceed north. Now, get under where the rope is, and 
against the wall and check it. Don will try to jump up and grab the rope, but 
it's too out of reach for him. He mentions Helen can likely help you with this 
situations[the girl has handy rope on her for these kinda situations, I guess]. 
Continue to ignore the blinking arrow over the bookcase here. You still can't 
use it properly yet. Go back and exit this place and go back and speak to Helen. 
She says she has to be there to examine the rope. Mika/Jean offers to stay 
behind to watch Jean/Mika, and Helen agrees, swapping into your group. Now that 
you have a new character, you'll notice she's likely at around the same level as 
you, and she has a good repertoire of abilities, possibly even 'Rebirth', which 
fully heals and revives the entire party[basically the same as the &quot;Angel's 
Wing&quot; item].</p>
<p><u>2C. The Mystery of the Quietus -</u> Now with Helen in tow, return to the large 
north room of the castle you were just in, testing Helen's skills in battle if 
possible. When you go and examine the rope, she says she can easily fix it, but 
with worry at something else. Don asks her what, and she says she senses a 
barrier beyond, blocking something[Helen also has good magic sensing powers], 
and then Flaid comes to a revelation: this place is the same castle that is 
rising out of the lake, hence all the water you were draining earlier. He says 
the barrier is likely holding back flood water, and that if removed, it will 
come out gushing out. Now, you can go and check the bookcase that pointer was 
flashing at. You'll find a book on the Hexen Wars, and Helen is surprised, 
realizing this castle is older than she or Flaid thought. As they read the book, 
some more backstory on the wars are mentioned, and at the end, Flaid again has a 
revelation: the Quietus has the magical properties that can dispel the magic 
field around that strange sword in the Janepo Ninja Castle's dungeon. When asked 
why by Marcus, Flaid explains the two swords seem to have some kind of 
connection. You'll get the Book of Hexen, and you can leave the Sunken Castle 
and head back to the Janepo Castle dungeon with the back entrance from the 
underground water cave. You'll notice on the way back through the sunken castle 
will have this odd pair of bottles on the ground. Checking these will give the 
party a random stat boost.</p>
<p><u>2D. Claiming the Mysterious Sword -</u> Head to the central room of the dungeon 
where the sword is, and examine it. Helen will tell Don to use the Quietus on 
the other sword, which he does. The barrier is dispelled, and you finally claim 
the sword. However, it isn't as simple as that. Upon getting it, you'll notice 
there are names engraved on the sword: Tara, Plo, Bonnie, Marcus, Clyde, 
Joleena, Vegeta, Rachel, Ness, Paula, Jeff, Poo, then Don, Marcus[no, not a 
typo, Marcus is mentioned TWICE on the sword, and you'll learn why later], 
Flaid, Mika, Jean and Helen's names, and then finally ZARBON'S name is on the 
sword as well. Completely befuddled to the meaning of all of this, you need to 
return to Mika/Jean and inform them of this development. Head back to the cave 
and talk to Mika/Jean. Either one will be peeved that Zarbon's name is on the 
sword with all of yours, and she/he wants to come back and help you locate 
Zarbon, however someone has to watch over Jean/Mika. Marcus will suggest he stay 
behind while Don, Flaid, Helen and Mika/Jean go and find/confront Zarbon. If 
you're playing on Alternate Route mode, Flaid will offer to stay behind as well 
and suggest Marcus go instead. On the normal mode, Marcus stays behind and Flaid 
goes with you, but in Alternate Route mode an choice menu will come up[Note: any 
dark blue options on these menus mean it is an alternate route you can choose]. 
Regardless of who you choose, Part 2 shortly after ends, transitioning to Part 
3.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Part 3: The Sword Shines</font></b></p>
<p><b><u>1. The Barrier of Monsters</u></b></p>
<p><u>1A. Cliffs of Doom! -</u> Flaid will have mentioned that you should go and see the girl at the 
lower cliffs, and ask if she might have any idea on Zarbon's whereabouts. As 
far-fetched as this might sound, you have no other real options. Go to the boat 
and take the shortcut to the lower cliffs[or just Teleport with Marcus/Flaid]. 
When you talk to the girl, she will tell you that she DID see Zarbon, and that 
he clambered up into the cave on the higher ledges of the lower cliffs[to the 
right of the ladder up the cliff], and now ropes that lead up to it will be 
there. Go up into the cave, and enter. In this strange looking area, go right at 
the first intersection, use the star, and also go up the stairs. You'll find 
yourself in a large area, but transparent walls block you from going anywhere 
except to the next steps. Go down the lower set of steps in this room to find 
yourself on the ledge overlooking the large room with the Hexen Wars book in the 
Sunken Castle[meaning the place you just came from must be the second floor of 
the castle, and the 'wall' being the barrier Helen sensed]. Walk over to the 
edge of the ledge[next to the rope], and if Helen is there[in this case, she 
is], she'll lower the rest of the rope. Allowing you to quickly get between the 
first and second floors. However go back the way you came and go back to the 
intersection in the inner cliffs. If you go left here, you'll just run into a 
dead end, well not a true dead end, but the stairs here are blocked so you can't 
reach them[you'll be able to reach here much later]. This leaves you the option 
of going north. If you read the secondary objective here, you'll be told there 
is a magical barrier blocking you from going any further, and that the Brown 
Chests power the barrier. However to turn the individual parts of the barrier 
off, you must purge each chest of the various monsters inside. Here is an 
explanation of each chest and it's inhabitants and surprises:</p>
<p>Leftmost Chest: First you'll deal with the following: 1 Cyberdemon and 2 
Barons on Very Easy, a Daemonite on Easy, a Dragon Knight on Normal, a 
Cyberdemon Ghost on Hard, a Hieroglyph[new monster, resistant to many elements] 
on Very Hard, and TWO Hieroglyphs on EXTREMELY Hard. You'll also receive various 
bonus EXP. Second, you get four KeroKeroColas. Third, you face several groups of 
monsters[5-6 groups], which all vary depending on difficulty. Finally, the first 
part of the barrier will go down, and you'll also be able to buy from the Clerk 
Demon in this chest. Buy what you need from here[lots of new stuff, depending on 
skill level]. All members also in addition learn a revival spell of some type 
depending on difficulty level.</p>
<p>Midleft Chest: First, you'll have 2 Barons on Very Easy, 2 Barons and 3 
Cacodemons and Easy, 8 Centaurs[new enemy, in fact one of the old monsters of 
the Hexen wars, still around to this day] on Normal, 5 Centaurs and 2 
Slaughtaurs[new enemy, stronger Centaur variant with stronger magic, etc] on 
Hard, 2 Cyberdemons on Very Hard, and a Cyberdemon Ghost on EXTREMELY Hard. 
You'll also get various extra coins after the battle. Secondly, all current 
members of your group will learn the 'Savior' spell[800-1200 HP recovery to all 
members]. Third, two groups of enemies will attack you, the type of enemies 
varying upon difficulty level. Then finally the chest is purged and the second 
piece of the barrier gone.</p>
<p>Midright Chest: First, you'll be subject to a LOSS of all characters' speed 
stat[major ow, unless you're on VERY Easy, where you'll instead GAIN 10 Speed 
for everyone]. On Easy, you lose 5 speed. On Normal, you lose 10. On Hard, you 
lose 15. On Very Hard, you lose 20. And on EXTREMELY HARD, you lose a whopping 
30 Speed. :(. Second, you'll get money. Third, a group of monsters attack you, 
the types vary upon skill level. After this, you win at least one Ethereal 
Crossbow[new weapon, Helen and a couple later characters can use], and various 
TP-restoring items. On Easy, you'll get TWO Ethereal Crossbows, and you'll get 
FOUR on VERY Easy. Now this chest is purged.</p>
<p>Rightmost Chest: First, you're whole party gets blasted by a massive sound 
wave that does between 250-4500 HP of damage[but won't kill anyone] depending on 
the skill level. However, you'll also receive either Iron or Dragon Helmets, 
which should be properly equipped. Second, you'll get a lot of coins[even on 
harder skill levels]. Third, you'll be attacked by various monsters. You'll win 
Kevlar/Goddess Dresses for your female characters depending on the skill level, 
which should be immediately equipped on Mika[if present] and Helen. Now this 
chest should be purged.</p>
<p><u>1B. Zarbon's Royal Guard -</u> Now that the barrier is gone, you can proceed to 
this fiery portion of the level. You can walk along the bridge to avoid damage 
from walking in the lava, or you can go your own way. You will fight various 
demons, including Daemonites and Archons in this area. Once you walk past the 
bridge, you'll come to a chasm you'll have to walk around, however there are at 
least 2 Cyberdemons, and 6 other demon-type monsters[on Harder skills, there can 
also be Cyberdemons here. Talk to one of them to start a battle. However THESE 
Cyberdemons are huge 'Super Cyberdemons', which have over 10,000 HP each, and 
can use Multi Bottle Rockets when weakened. The best way to attack them is with 
Draining spells. 'Dorein' and 'HP Magnet' are the best moves against them, which 
Don and Helen should have by now. When they are all gone, you'll notice they 
drop a strange bottle on the ground. You'll get a random bonus HP, TP, Attack, 
Defense, Mind or Speed when you check this. Now head into the next area.</p>
<p><u><b>2. A Battle of Sword and Ki!</b></u></p>
<p><u>2A. One Final Challenge -</u> Now you'll find yourself in another castle-like 
place. Head up to where the 8 dormant Cyberdemons are. Ahead of them is Zarbon 
himself[finally]. However, as you try to walk by the sleeping Cyberdemons, 
there's a high chance they'll wake up and attack you before you can get away. 
They are all Super Cyberdemons, much like the ones outside of the room. Use 
draining spells to get rid of them as fast as possible before they start 
wrecking havoc on your party's status. When they are dead, Zarbon awaits.</p>
<p><u>2B. The Miguel and the Monster -</u> Walk up to Zarbon and speak to him. He will 
commend you for finding him, but he'll again vow that you won't get in the way 
of his 'vengeance'[again, it seems you're not necessarily his main targets, just 
a nuisance to him]. Mika/Jean want to ask him a small question, to which Zarbon 
complies. When asked why his name is on the mysterious sword, Zarbon curses 
angrily, asking how YOU were able to obtain the sword before him. Helen however 
realizes the truth of this guy's identity. She reveals this is the same Zarbon 
who once served the intergalatical tyrant known as Frieza. Zarbon is impressed 
with Helen's conclusion, and removes his 'elf' disguise, becoming what he really 
looks like, green haired, light blue face and whiteish armor with a cape, and 
all elegantly dressed. He then tell you to come to him so he can &quot;tear you to 
pieces&quot;, and the battle starts.</p>
<p>Zarbon is a lot more difficult than Lenako in Janepo Ninja Castle, and 
depending on the skill level, he may or may not have extra flunkies helping him 
out. Also, his stats also vary depending on the skill, and can be anywhere from 
36000 to 58500 HP[VERY Easy to EXTREMELY Hard]. He possesses mostly a new array 
of moves, and can also use Kamehameha attacks, PK Flash[which inflicts random 
ailments, sometimes even instant KO], and various physical combos[blunt 
elemental, which will more hurt Helen and Don than either Marcus/Flaid or 
Mika/Jean]. He can also use Keal, which heals ~1700 HP per use. The best moves 
to use on him are Typeless elemental spells. If someone has Surou[ra], use it on 
him, for it might Slow him and make the battle that much less agitating. Also, 
he can 'Discern' you, which is a scan move directed at YOUR party, and makes it 
seem he's reading your stats[although it will allow you see how powerful your 
stats are at this point too]. :P Also, if Flaid is there, he should use 'All Up' 
a few times, which will increase all four types of stats for the whole group, so 
you can attack more often, do more damage, etc. Just remember that if someone is 
KOed, their stats are reset, rather they were greater or less than their 
original stats when they got KOed.</p>
<p>After you do in most of his HP, he growls at you, mentioning about &quot;you 
getting in the way of Frieza's death&quot;, and he transforms his body into a larger, 
uglier creature. Now he has between 48000 and 78000 HP more to take off, and he 
is a lot faster, more powerful, and has stronger moves. He also might possess 
the 'Chou Kamehameha', which does an average of around 4000 damage to the whole 
group[except for Flaid, who is resistant to it, and will only take around 2000 
HP]. He also has a super move known as the 'Genki Dama'. Do not be fooled, there 
are two versions of this he has[and they look exactly the same, but do different 
damages]. The one you'll want to beware of are any that he does just after using 
'Discern', as he will always use one that can do upwards of 5500+ HP in damage 
to the whole group[2750+ HP for Flaid]. The best way to defend from it is to 
acknowledge when he uses Discern, and then have as many characters use the 
'Defend' option, which will cut all damage by 3/4s[even all skills and magic are 
effected], so the Genki Dama will only do about 1400+ damage to a Defending 
character when he throws it down on them. When he is finally almost dead, he'll 
be in disbelief at you and the battle ends.</p>
<p><u><b>3. Frieza's Foul</b></u></p>
<p><u>3A. The Wrath of Frieza -</u> For some reason, Zarbon reverts back to his natural 
form, and is cursing you greatly, not for DEFEATING him though, but because he 
claims all your fighting with him has likely attracted Frieza's attention. Helen 
asks him if Frieza wasn't already dead. Zarbon explains that something revived 
Frieza, and that Frieza is after him. Don tries to ask him why they couldn't all 
have just joined forces in the first place, but before Zarbon can reply, Frieza 
appears nearby, and threatens Zarbon with death. Zarbon defiantly asks Frieza to 
scan his power, so to see the remarkable improvement. Now is when it is possible 
for ANOTHER alternate route to occur. If Marcus is present in the party, the 
game will inform you that a great anger is welling in Marcus towards Frieza, and 
asks if you should let him vent it out at him. If you want to superpower up 
Marcus in the long run, you definitely want to select yes. If you hit no, then 
it things will proceed as if you were on the normal path, only that Marcus is in 
Flaid's place.</p>
<p><u>3B. A Fruitless Battle, Or Is It?[Normal Route, Flaid or Marcus] -</u> Frieza 
complies to Zarbon's wish, taking it as a final request. He is in fact impressed 
with the jump from 33,000 to 51,000,000 that Zarbon underwent between their last 
meeting, but he says that he too has strengthened roughly the same amount of 
times, and that he can still easily take Zarbon out. Zarbon tells him to prove 
it, and YOU are thrust into the battle with Frieza[because you're kinda in his 
way of reaching Zarbon]. Now, do note something, YOU CANNOT WIN THIS FIGHT. You 
won't necessarily get KOed, but after he takes so many turns, Frieza will use a 
massive attack that leaves the whole team on the verge of death, ending the 
fight, and appearing to kill the group[they're all sprawled out on the ground]. 
Now you have control of Zarbon[well, for the fight coming up, you do]. Zarbon, 
despite just witnessing the very people who defeated him go down with ease, 
still challenges Frieza[must be quite a bone he has to pick if he's that brash]. 
Another battle occurs. However, despite how bad the situation looks, there is 
one thing you can do. Have Zarbon DEFEND, and just let Frieza work himself up. 
After about 4-6 turns of this, Frieza will comment that Zarbon really has 
strengthened, but that it will not matter in the long run, and the battle 
ends[whew!].</p>
<p>Now, Frieza will be in for the first major shock since his 'revival', when 
Helen manages to awaken and cast Rebirth on the whole group[man, she is good 
:D], to Frieza's utter shock, thinking he had killed them easily. Your whole 
group is brought back, and you're in control of them again. Frieza will actually 
credit you as human beings, &quot;since you actually lived through my attacks&quot;, as he 
says, but he tells you and Zarbon that your luck has run out, and you go into 
another fight with him. In this fight, you'll notice Zarbon is there, but he's 
not playable, and he's facing towards Frieza. Also, you can accidentally attack 
him[not that you'll do much damage]. Frieza proclaims he'll take all of you 
down, and Zarbon tells Frieza he is a new man, and that now that he knows the 
truth about his homeworld's destruction being linked to Frieza himself, that 
Frieza will die. Now, first off, if Flaid is there, All Up is a good move here, 
because you'll be needing it soon enough. Do note that when Zarbon takes his 
turns in battle, he'll try to attack Frieza with various moves, but Frieza will 
retaliate, and eventually will be annoyed to the point he'll go to his 100% 
power[complete with a positive status called '100%' to accommodate this], thus 
DOUBLING his current stats, and making him much tougher[now you know why I told 
you to have Flaid use All Up if he was there]. Frieza however can also use 
Reenergize, which will increase his stats even further, and making it very hard 
to struggle against him, even with All Up being used. He'll also use moves like 
Kienzan, Kienzan Volley, Mini Death Ball, possibly even Super Death Ball[which 
is likely gonna wipe out anyone not defending]. Now, you have to hold off 
Frieza[unfortunately], while Zarbon gets the idea to accumulate energy into a 
CHOU Genki Dama, which he plans to use to annihilate Frieza with. As the battle 
proceeds, Frieza will first compliment you for your efforts against Zarbon, but 
will be disappointed you didn't actually finish him off. If Marcus is here, 
he'll attack Frieza with two Kienzan attacks automatically. If Jean is also 
present, he'll do the exact thing, and Frieza will get pissed that two other 
people have learned how to use one of his 'signature moves'. </p>
<p>Now, all you have to do here is basically SURVIVE until Zarbon is ready to 
launch the Genki Dama[his 25th overall turn in the battle, all the events in 
this battle are done on HIS turn, however he'll usually be the slowest person in 
the fight, so these events take time to occur]. When Zarbon is ready, he will 
throw the Genki Dama down on him, doing the combined total of Don, Marcus, 
Flaid, Mika, Jean, Helen and his own Max HPs, and then doing an additional total 
of 53782 - 109739 in Damage[in other words, this thing HURTS :) ] to Frieza, and 
ending the battle. You'll win two Glacier Claws, THREE Mega Spheres, and 145,000 
EXP for all of this. Frieza dies, and Zarbon comments on 'Quake' and how they'll 
be sending him to his doom as well soon enough. Zarbon starts a conversation 
with your group, and examines the sword you got from the castle, and realizes 
some of the people on the sword are names he's heard before, while he had been 
originally revived by 'Quake' before he deserted him. The name 'Tara' stuck out 
specifically, so Zarbon assumes she was a major role in a past defeat or 
something of Quake's, and he tells you that you and him must get in contact with 
Tara and her group of heroes as soon as possible. He then teleports off, but not 
before saying he is now your ally and that you'll meet again, and after some 
in-group discussion, Marcus/Flaid tells you the Winnowing Hall[for non-Hexen 
players, this is the first level of the original game] has been emitting 
'tele-connective' energy that can connect two planets abilities to commune to 
each other, and suggests you go here. Helen, being the Hexen wars know-it-all, 
tells you that you have to go back to the cave you used to reach Janepo Ninja 
Castle at the beginning of the game, and that a divergence in the road will take 
you to the Hall. With this, Part 3 ends, transitioning to Part 4.</p>
<p><u>3Ba. Vengeance for Tanrasus[Alternate Route, Marcus] -</u> If you hit yes when it 
asked you about Marcus's anger, Frieza will check his scouter, and be impressed 
with Zarbon's large jump in power since their last meeting, but Marcus angrily 
interrupts Frieza before anything can proceed further. Frieza is both amused and 
agitated at the same time that a 'simple cat' is trying to tell him what to do. 
Don will try to stop Marcus from getting too mad, but Marcus tells him and the 
others that Frieza is now his to destroy, and says that it's a personal matter. 
Frieza wonders if the two had met before. Marcus comments that they haven't, but 
that Frieza had personally killed a good friend of Marcus's in the past. Frieza 
simply replies that he's killed billions and can't possibly remember them all. 
Marcus decides to let him figure out what he means, and challenges Frieza to 
one-on-one combat. Zarbon calls Marcus a fool and tries to reason with him, but 
Marcus summons an insane burst of strength, and uses his energy to pick up Don, 
Mika/Jean, Helen and Zarbon, and throw them away from the battle into a safer 
area. Zarbon is morbidly afraid of what is about to happen, and Marcus and 
Frieza begin their battle, shaking the foundation of the room as they begin. 
Also, keep your ears open. If you hear Marcus meow several times and then a 
series of screen shaking, which normally happens, this indicates his change into 
a 'Nekosa' which is an elevated level of strength, skills, and even elemental 
and status resistances.</p>
<p>After some good ol' fashion bantering, Marcus might gain a couple levels, and 
his stats also get an additional boost. He is also Guarded, and will regenerate 
about 2200 HP per turn, so he is both faster and much more powerful than he 
usually is. Marcus should use Grand Cross immediately, as it will almost always 
Slow Frieza, which is even more helpful in this battle. Now he should use Mini 
Death Ball or Chou Kamehameha on Frieza over and over. Don't worry about healing 
from any moves Frieza might use, as you'll automatically recover HP every time 
either Marcus or Frieza make a move. Once you do so much damage, Frieza will 
curse himself for losing to a mere housecat, and he declares that he has yet 
begun to fight, mentioning of his 100% power, and transforms to full power, 
again getting the 100% status[which now protects him from other negative 
ailments, so you won't be able to use Grand Cross on him anymore]. He will state 
how he'll crush Marcus, but Marcus tells Frieza he is losing his cool, and that 
it will both cost him the battle and his life. Marcus will likely gain 1-2 more 
levels, and more stat bonuses. In addition, he will gain several new attacks, 
which you normally won't be able to get for him until much later in the game. 
You should demonstrate all of these new moves on Frieza so you're both familiar 
with him, and because he takes a lot of damage from almost all of them. Gemini 
Blast and Astro Crush are specifically useful on Frieza. After taking even more 
damage, Frieza eventually becomes flabbergasted that Marcus is still matching 
him 1-on-1, and explodes all of his powers outward in a final, desperate move 
that harms Marcus, but not enough to kill him. Marcus scolds Frieza for both his 
failure to kill him, and that he almost killed the others outside the battle 
with his attack, and he does his own explosion attack that easily engulfs the 
weakened Frieza and annihilates him. The battle ends and everyone[including 
Zarbon] gains 216,000 EXP, 3 Mega Spheres, and other prizes, and the light dies 
down, with Frieza gone, and Marcus standing triumphantly.</p>
<p>Basically, Zarbon is impressed beyond worlds with Marcus's performance with 
Frieza, saying he didn't even need to use his Chou Genki Dama. Marcus tells the 
group about Tanrasus, a good friend of his from the past that was killed 
personally by Frieza, and that seeing Frieza in person sparked a great anger in 
him. Zarbon examines the sword, tells the group about Tara and how they must 
find her and her friends, etc. He allies up with Don, but he teleports off on 
his own to see if any other danger from Frieza is around on Cronos. Marcus will 
then mention of Winnowing Hall, etc, etc. Part 3 ends, moving on to Part 4.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Part 4: Who is Tara?</font></b></p>
<p><u><b>1. Reach out to Tara!</b></u></p>
<p><u>1A. Getting Prepared to Meet Tara -</u> Once Part 4 begins, you'll find yourself 
back outside of the caves on the Lower Cliffs. Most people miss out on a very 
useful item because they usually move head immediately. Go BACK into the cave, 
or Teleport to Zarbon's Throne Room. Inside, walk up to where you last saw 
Frieza before he died. Walk over the spot and check it. Usually, you'll get a 
'Frieza Sigil' for your effort[2+ on easier levels]. This handy accessory is 
gives the wearer permanent 100% status, hence DOUBLING all of their stats from 
what they normally were. However, their hitrate becomes 87% and they can miss at 
vital moments if they are not careful using this. If you beat Frieza using 
Marcus, the Sigil will work very nicely with him. If not, then you may choose 
anyone at your discretion, or wait to give it to a future character.</p>
<p><u>1B. Head for Winnowing Hall -</u> If you wish, head back to the underground water 
cave and fill Marcus/Flaid and Jean/Mika in on the developments of the recent 
times. They'll let you know that they will be joining up with you soon, since 
Jean/Mika is nearly healed. Now head for the cave just outside of Janepo Ninja 
Castle. You'll notice a new opening after you turn right. Go in, and navigate 
the small maze, being careful of rare, and dangerous Hieroglyphs fighting you. 
At the end of the maze, you'll emerge on the outskirts of Winnowing Hall. Head 
east to find the entryway, and head in, going right and over the stairs to the 
back and sub-level of the hall. You'll notice there are walls blocking two 
possible ways in, so you can only go one way. If your on Very Hard mode, there 
will be a Brown chest just before the big room ahead. First there will be 3 
Hieroglyphs inside, then 18750-37500 coins, then SIX CyberDemon ghosts, and then 
finally you'll meet Butan[this is similar to the one chest in Janepo Ninja 
castle, the one that only appeared on EXTREMELY Hard]. He'll give you a Guarding 
Sigil if you buy from him, and he sells various items. The Guarding Sigil is 
almost as good as a Frieza Sigil, except with no increase to Attack. After 
you're done[or if you're just not on Very Hard Mode], proceed up, and step on 
the black square in the middle of the room. Flaid/Marcus will mention they feel 
the tele-connective energy, and they move onto the spot, and he/he begins to 
call out to Tara. The screen pans over left, past the one blocking wall, to 
another, similar room, where Zarbon is standing on a black space and making a 
call to Tara as well. When he finishes his call, the screen fades out to the 
next part, telling the player of the scene transition to Earth.</p>
<p><u><b>2. Tara, Youngest Hero of Earth!</b></u></p>
<p><u>2A. I am Tara, Hear me Roar! -</u> Now the scene will fade in and you'll get to 
see this blue-haired, pigtailed girl walking up and picking some flowers. She 
comments on peace for over 2 years, and the P icon will flash, and you will gain 
control over her, but you will not be able to open your menu for the time being. 
Walk her downwards, towards the little island surrounded by a river, and enter 
the house you see here. Inside you'll see another cat and dog, both looking 
similar to Marcus and Flaid, except the cat is larger, and fluffy white, and the 
dog is larger than Flaid, and also lighter furred. You can talk to them in any 
order you wish, but when you talk to the cat, you'll learn the girl you're 
controlling is TARA herself, and the cat is known as Plo. Also, once you've been 
identified as Tara, you'll be able to access the menu once again. Plo will add 
to your group now. Now go to the dog, and she will reveal she is Bonnie, another 
of Tara's friends, and join you. Both animals speak of 'Marcus', which is 
actually a DIFFERENT Marcus from the one we've been talking about so much 
before, and that this Marcus is upstairs with an urgent message. Take Plo and 
Bonnie with Tara and go upstairs, and find the darker skinned man who looks a 
little like Don. This is 'Marcus M.', who is technically like a fosterfather to 
Tara. When you speak to him, he'll tell you of two messages, one from a 
&quot;Zarbon&quot;, and another from a &quot;Flaid&quot;/&quot;Marcus&quot;, speaking of great trouble. Tara's 
arch nemesis Quake has supposedly been freed of his prison in the 'Dead Zone', 
and that he is taking refuge on the world of Cronos. Tara mentions of her cousin 
Paula telling her about Korax's history up there, and that Quake's being there 
is trouble. Marcus M. asks you, Plo and Bonnie to go to the Tower of Life on the 
hill to find the portal field to Cronos. Tara asks him if he will be coming as 
well. Marcus M. tells her he'll be trying to gather up their old gang of 
friends, and that he'll follow them soon enough.</p>
<p>Now, go back down to the front room, and notice the pair of walls in the 
upper left part of the room. You can walk behind the lower wall to descend a 
hidden staircase into the basement. There are several chests here, each with 
various armor, stat-up items, and the most important item here is the 'Chthon's 
Fang', which when equipped as an accessory will allow a character to attack 
twice as often with the Fight command[think of the offering in FF6, except half 
as powerful]. When you are done, you may leave the basement and exit the house. 
Roam the field of flower bushes, and head towards the north-center part of the 
map, where there is a raised cliff with a tower and a tombstone on it. Get there 
through the cave, and check the tombstone. You'll learn of Tara's REAL father, 
Clyde Tomato, who supposedly was destroyed in the final stretch of the past 
battle with Quake. After everyone vows to stop Quake here, enter the tower.</p>
<p><u>2B. The Tower of Life -</u> From the entrance, you'll notice there are three sets 
of steps. Ignore the top set for now. The path beyond has two walls currently 
blocking you from what lies around the corner. It's recommended to go west 
first. Up the steps, there is a red chest with 12 Large Medikits, near a flight 
of steps, and another wall that blocks more goodies beyond. Up THESE steps, you 
may notice in the lower center-left area of this room that it looks like there's 
a wall you walk in front of, but you can't. The reason is because there's 
another red chest with a set of Ninja Stars[Mika/Jean] in this chest. Go up and 
to the right side of the room, and flip the switch here to remove a wall that 
would normally be blocking you on the east side of the tower. Inside the Brown 
Chest, you'll fight four Daemonites, and four Archons of Hell. After defeating 
them, you get random bonus experience. Next up inside are more coins. The next 
thing you'll deal with is a powerful creature known as the 'Guardian'. This 
monstrosity has 99750 HP, and a good set of attacks for the current point in the 
game. However it has one major weakness. It hates electricity. Furthermore, 
Bonnie normally starts off equipped with STORM Claws, which deal lightning 
damage. If possible, up Bonnie's attack as great as you can, and have her attack 
the Guardian with her claws. If you had the dumbfounding foresight to give Plo 
Storm Claws as well, do the same with Plo and have him attack it physically as 
well. Tara should just use healing, thunder or shielding moves in this fight. 
When the Guardian finally breaks down, you receive a hefty 15 Ancient Capsules, 
2 Regen Sigils, and 1 Regen2 Sigil. :D</p>
<p>Head back to the main center room. Now go down the east path. Since the wall 
SHOULD be down here, go north past where it would be first. You'll come upon 2 
Red Chests and a Cyberdemon Ghost blocking a switch. The left chest has a pair 
of Titanium Swords, the right chest has 48500 coins, and checking the Cyberdemon 
Ghost will enter a fight with FOUR of them. Once they are dead[Draining/Non-elemental 
spells work best], flip the switch behind him to remove one of the main two 
walls blocking your way out of this crazy tower! Also, you might notice there is 
a crate to your southwest, and another brown chest directly west. Inspect the 
Chest first, in which 2 Hieroglyphs attack first, then gaining a random amount 
of Mind-Ups, then fighting a group of Super Cyberdemons[along with varying 
cohorts depending on Difficulty level]. After they are dead, the Clerk 
Demon[actually a ghost :P] will sell mainly Magic-based items, which you can use 
at your discretion. Now go up to the crate and push it down to reveal a hole. 
Fall through it to land in the tower's basement, where there's two red chests, 
and two GRAY chests. The gray chests can only be opened after various 
requirements are fulfilled. The top Red Chest contains 2 Life Seeds, which are 
basically Angel's Wings, with 5 charges to them each. The bottom red chest has a 
suit of Frieza Armor and two Frieza 
Claws[Marcus/Flaid/Plo/Bonnie/Zarbon/??????/????/??????]. Now go back up the 
steps to be back in the center of the main room, taking note that you must press 
the use button while over the steps here to go down them into the basement 
again. Head back to the east side and go the low road this time, opening the red 
chest next to the steps for 5 Angel Wings. Up in this room, there is another red 
chest at the bottom of this room with two MEGA SPHERES inside of it. The switch 
in the northwest part of the room now removes the wall in the west half of the 
tower that you noticed was blocking you earlier. This means head back west.</p>
<p>In the west part of the tower, proceed past the now removed wall, noticing 
two more red chest and ANOTHER Cyberdemon Ghost. &gt;_&lt; 3 SOUL SPHERES are in the 
left red chest, while one suit of Dragon Armor and a Dragon Helmet lay in the 
right chest. The Cyberdemon Ghost is again actually a group of four you must 
fight to reach the switch. This switch removes the last wall in the upper-center 
part of the tower. Now head back to the main room, and go up the north stairs, 
passing into the room with the crazy-looking void like thing in the middle. As 
Tara steps near it, she'll wonder if it will go to Cronos. However, when you 
take a step on it, you'll back up a step, Tara mentioning something feeling 
wrong. Suddenly you are sent into a battle with a large beast, aka the Earth 
Behemoth. This creature has 32000 HP, Image status[so you can't use normal 
attacks], and strong Fire/Thunder attacks. He can also use various Furea-style 
attacks. Noise and Missile attacks would work best on him, but there's little 
chance you'll have anything of that sort that you can use. It also takes normal 
damage from Holy and Dark attacks, so those are your best bet, along with 
attacks that inflict the Berserk ailment. Once it falls, you can walk onto the 
portal, and be whisked off to your next destination.</p>
<p><u><b>3. The Alliance of Earth and Cronos!</b></u></p>
<p><u>3A. Tara meets Don -</u> When you arrive, step off the portal square to hear some 
dialogue from Tara, Plo and Bonnie which basically reveals you are now on 
Cronos. Also, you'll notice you've made it to Winnowing Hall, on the left side 
of the underground area[near the room Zarbon was using to call out to Tara's 
group]. Go down and then to the right, locating the room where you took Don's 
group. When you enter the room, Tara's group and Don's group break out into a 
long scene, where Tara reveals her identity to Don's group, surprising the 
majority of them, who had believed she was 15-16 at least, where as she is only 
12 in truth. After more discussion, Marcus M. speaks up from behind, coming in 
behind Tara, and telling her that he was afraid of Quake expecting their attempt 
to Cronos and came as fast as possible[however forfeiting the chance to summon 
their other friends to them for the time being]. Marcus the cat and Marcus M. 
acknowledge each other, and then Plo and Marcus[the cat] analyze one another. If 
Marcus defeated Frieza, Flaid will mention of it to Tara's group here. If not, 
Flaid will say he is a very good treasure hunter. Then Bonnie analyzes Flaid, 
and asks for his age, to which an embarrassed Flaid replies, then revealing that 
he was sent to become Don's guardian. Don is not aware of the part about Flaid 
being meant to be his guardian, and ask him to elaborate on such later, to which 
Flaid accepts. Marcus M. interrupts by relating the flashback of Tara and her 
friends' first battle with Quake you actually get to see the events, except in 
black and white]. Tara sometimes also speaks during this. Basically Tara's group 
confronted Quake and began battling him, until he summoned the horrid volcano 
beast, Chthon. After discovering of Chthon's weakness to thunder attacks, the 
beast was destroyed, leaving Quake completely vulnerable to the team's attacks, 
or so they thought. They soon learn that Quake was intangible, despite appearing 
to be in a physical form. Tara tells everyone about how her now-dead father 
Clyde gave her the confidence to learn 'Final Gate', a powerful banishment spell 
that sends all victims into the 'Dead Zone', a world meant to trap immortal 
beings that were way too powerful to handle in an immediate confrontation. Quake 
is sucked up into Tara's first gate, and the group rejoices, as the flashback 
ends.</p>
<p>Bonnie is confused to how Quake might have escaped this time. Zarbon mentions 
that he'd heard stories of the Dead Zone as a child, and that another immortal 
might have gained the power to open the rift to the containment realm from the 
outside, and reached in and pulled Quake out, allowing all of the problems as of 
recently to start. Tara and Don make agreements to forge an alliance between 
both their groups, and also between the worlds of Earth and Cronos, and the 
scene teleports to the underground water cave, where everyone up to now has 
gathered. Zarbon tells Don of a place known as 'Nemadonus'[Cronoian for &quot;Don and 
Company's Home Base&quot;], and gives him an item known as the 'Polymorph Amulet, 
which would allow him to teleport to this place to switch his allies[or him for 
another character]. Basically from this point on, pressing the '4' key or using 
the Polymorph Amulet allows you to go to Nemadonus, which is where you can 
change party members.</p>
<p><u><b>4. Old Acquaintances: Zarbon and Vegeta</b></u></p>
<p><u>4A. Old Rivalries Quelled -</u> Immediately use the Polymorph Amulet. You'll be 
asked if you want to remove your current group after landing on Nemadonus. If 
you choose yes, you'll be asked to input a number for a character when you 
arrive, which will add them to your group as the first member. If you hit no, 
then your group will just be teleported up there, and no automatic changes 
occur. It's up to you what you want to do, but if you do remove Don here, then 
swap him in for Zarbon as your first character.</p>
<p>Immediately go to Nemadonus and go into the house north of you. This is where 
all of your party members are. Don't worry yet about the other parts of the 
place. Inside the house, you'll notice there's a long table with all the 
human/humanoid characters and several clear seats. These seats will fit later 
characters. Walking up to one of the characters at the table and talking to them 
will ask you if you want to add them to your group[at least if you're not 
already at the max of 4 people]. If you say yes, that person joins you and the 
representation of them at the table becomes transparent. Talking to the 
representation will ask if you want to remove that character. If you do, they 
will become solid again, etc. There is another, smaller table where the animals 
all are. Talking to them/their representations will do the same thing. Now you 
should know how to change members. You should now go to the switch on the wall 
to the left of the main table. Press it once[you'll see why later]. Now go up 
around the walls and past the animals to find both the Piano Girl at a new 
piano, and some beds, one of which has an item on it. Checking it will acquire 
you the 'Rand Pendant', allowing you to summon a powerful ally that will pummel 
a single enemy with a vicious blunt-elemental combo[reusable battle item].</p>
<p>Now, go talk to the Piano Girl. She'll tell you Zarbon brought her up to 
Nemadonus to both heal your group and play music for you. She'll also mention of 
two people you can go out of your way to get, but don't HAVE to get[referring to 
two of the secret characters]. She will then give you the 'Jukebox', which 
allows you to temporarily change the music[like a music test, although if you 
have Cheats on, you can use it anytime before this point by using the '5' key, 
which also now works while you have the Jukebox]. Talk to her a second time and 
she'll reveal first off, that an acquaintance of Zarbon's is back on Earth, who 
she believes is willing to help you in the fight against Quake. She tells you 
that there is a cave on Nemadonus that leads to a separate Cliffside from which 
you must jump to reach where this person is. She will then tell you of a place 
back on Cronos called &quot;Janepo Illusion Forest&quot;, and that while it is small from 
the outside, that it's deceptively huge on the inside. She believes Quake may 
have some forces in there, or that there would be some clue to where to find 
him. However she mentions the entrance is so low that only Marcus, Plo, Flaid 
and Bonnie can enter as a group. This will give you two primary objectives to 
worry about. You should first get Tara in your group, and quickly return to the 
underground water cave. You'll notice some ropes are now on the ledges where you 
couldn't reach before. One has a brown chest at the upper left corner, but 
ignore it for now. The ledge at the leftmost part of the map has four chests. 
One green, two red, and one brown. Only Tara can open the Green chest, but when 
she does, she'll get a 'Grandleon' [Tara only] to equip as a new weapon. The red 
chest have Goddess Ribbons and a Goddess Dress in them. Now go back to Nemadonus 
after this.</p>
<p>Now after getting whoever you want[including Zarbon as one member], leave the 
house, and go into the caves west of the house. Inside this cave, go all the way 
into the back, and go left, and leave the cave through that path. You'll find 
yourself on a cliff face west of the cave you came from. Walk over to the edge, 
and jump when it asks you to. You'll land on a small island on Earth. Going 
inside, you'll notice there's not too much on the lower floor, although there is 
a strange floating cat-like thing named Puar, but she's not important at this 
point. Go upstairs from here, and at one of the tables will me a man in blue, 
with troll-shaped, spiky black hair. Talk to him, and Zarbon identifies him as 
Vegeta, the original prince of the Saiya-jin race, who also served with him 
alongside Frieza in the past. However Vegeta will be in a trance, and Zarbon 
realizes Quake or something related to the matter is trying to take him over and 
turn him evil again. Zarbon will use his powers to snap him out of it, and the 
two former rivals speak to each other again after 13 years. In all of the 
discussion, Vegeta learns that he was the one who inadvertently destroyed 
Kerda-sei, Zarbon's old homeworld, as a disguised order of Frieza's. Vegeta will 
decide to join you, wondering if Zarbon has really decided to change, and to 
protect you if he should turn on you[although he doesn't tell you this]. He 
teleports up to Nemadonus, and now you have a new friend to play around with. 
Now go back to Nemadonus.</p>
<p><u>4B. The Strange Tent -</u> Now, with Vegeta and Zarbon in your party, and 
switching in at least Mika[or Jean if you went down his path] with someone else, 
go to the Piano Girl. She'll congratulate you on finding Vegeta, and then she 
will mention now of a strange tent down on Cronos, outside of the waterfalls[you 
may have noticed it early in the game, but you wouldn't be able to do much with 
it at that point], and she'll tell you Vegeta can handle the job if you take him 
there. So do so and return to the Janepo Waterfalls and enter the tent. Vegeta 
will see the crystal table on the edge of the tent, and examine it. His presence 
causes the crystal to explode, revealing a stairway underneath it. Go down the 
stairs and enter the large room ahead. You'll see a large machine on the left 
side of the room. If you walk into it, you'll appear to be teleported, but 
you'll only end up right back where you started, except you'll notice the room 
has changed[cracked walls, broken tables], and Vegeta will wonder about 
something. Go and leave the room up the steps, and then exit the tent...</p>
<p><u><b>5. Future Shock! WTH?!</b></u></p>
<p><u>5A. The Dreadful Era of Robots -</u> Emerging from the tent, you will find a 
surprise awaiting for you. The waterfalls you left are definitely not the ones 
you've arrived at now. There are graves littering the landscape, parts of the 
ground are damaged, the lake shore is altered, the skies are scorched to Hell 
and back, and in addition, as you walk around to explore what the heck happened, 
you'll be pulled into battles with these strange flying pod-like robots with 
claws, which wield a variety of artillery attacks, like Rockets, BFGs, 
Chainguns, Shotguns, etc. These robots appear in up to as much as groups of 
four, and they can do a good number on you at first, especially if you get back 
attacked and pincer attacked. If Tara is here for these fights, Final Gate can 
do a world of good, able to kill, or almost kill these things in a single hit. 
Another interesting creature is the 'Molecule', which usually appear by 
themselves, but have a nasty Image status, and high speed. It's hard to kill 
these buggers since they run away when they get weak, but one yields 200,000 
exp[o_O] if you can kill it. 6 of these can normally increase your current group 
to level 99 in a hurry if you can take them.</p>
<p>From here, you can explore the lake, the upper cliffs[where Don met Marcus], 
the lower cliffs, the inner cliffs where you found Zarbon hiding, the 
underground water cave, or you can head towards the cave near Janepo Ninja 
Castle. Going to the inner cliffs can yield you a new clerk demon with better 
items, but there is a dead end here for now, so you'll end up returning to where 
you came from. There is not much of interest at the upper cliffs, except that 
the Rand Pendant can allow you to smash certain rocks you couldn't earlier, 
which have items in them. One at the upper cliffs have 4 Franklin Badges inside, 
which increase Thunder Resistance for one person. The underground water cave has 
nothing of interest in it either. Basically, you'll end up eventually heading 
for the cave near the castle. When you get here, there are slightly stronger 
monsters parties, and a rare possibility of meeting a group of EIGHT 
Molecules[instant Level 99 to any group if they can kill all eight]. Also, 
you'll notice a female Ninja, apparently from the castle, is standing around 
out here. Also, there are more smashable rocks, one containing 20 Malak Shards, 
and the second with a 'Megami Ribbon' which should be given to Tara if she's 
there. Talking to the Ninja with Mika[or Jean if you went down his path] will 
reveal some startling information: First off, you're in a alternate future. 
Second, in this time, all of you and your friends were killed by a bio-android 
known as Cell, who had ravaged the whole of Cronos and then disappeared. Third, 
that Vegeta has actually encountered Cell in the past, and is willing to tear 
him a new one for this atrocity. The Ninja will tell you he was last seen in the 
inner cliffs, and that he had even defeated Don before he vanished. Now you know 
what you need to do.</p>
<p><u>5B. The Sundering of Cell -</u> Go to the inner cliffs, see the clerk demon here 
if you need, and head to where you found Zarbon. If you came here BEFORE talking 
to the Ninja, the path will have been blocked. Also, if you did go back before, 
you'll realize Cell is aware you're coming to him, and has unbarred the path to 
him. Now entered the wrecked throne room, and go to the throne. Cell is there, 
waiting for you. Now realize, this is an important point in the game, and most 
people are unaware of the fact you can handle this two possible ways:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Method 1, The Less Favorable:</font> Make sure to NOT have both Zarbon and Vegeta in 
the current group. When you go to talk to Cell, he will seem depressed, and he 
will actually ask you to KILL HIM. At this, you'll enter a battle with him. He 
isn't as dangerous to you likely as the Ninja made him seem, and he only starts 
to get really dangerous as he gets closer to defeat, but do still be careful. 
Once you beat him, he'll actually thank you for freeing him from 'Shaft's Curse' 
and will become a spiritual essence, dead for all time... Boo, you just killed 
someone who would've been of better use to you. &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Method 2, The Most Favorable:</font> Make sure to have ZARBON AND VEGETA in the 
current group. When you talk to Cell, Vegeta and Zarbon will demand to know what 
he's doing. Cell is shocked to see you, considering he isn't yet aware that 
you're from the present. He then asks you if you want him to tell it to you long 
or short. You can choose, but the gist of it that he was revived by Quake, after 
the death of Frieza at the ends of Zarbon[or Marcus if you did it that way], and 
that he was made the 3rd in command, below who he calls the &quot;Dark Priest, 
Shaft&quot;. Zarbon asks who Shaft is anyways, and Cell explains he was the immortal 
who is responsible for freeing Quake from the Dead Zone in both timelines, and 
that after Cell succeeded with killing your future selves, that the 
ramifications of all of it got to him, and he turned allegiance to good, and 
destroyed Shaft in a climatic confrontation, and absorbed some of his powers. He 
also mentions of Vegeta being turned evil, but killed by Shaft, the Dark Priest 
apparently having foreseen a betrayal, which he had failed to do the same for 
Cell. After all is said and done, Vegeta and Zarbon, in a bizarre twist of fate, 
offer Cell the chance to help them to repent for his past mistakes. Cell is 
shocked at Vegeta's offer, remembering Vegeta being hell-bent to kill him in the 
past. Vegeta explains perhaps even Cell can change, and Zarbon offers Cell a 
Polymorph Amulet. Cell accepts somewhat reluctantly, and he will teleport to 
Nemadonus[despite the fact YOU cannot use the Amulet while in the future], 
adding the first secret character of the game to your ranks[and the only 
character who doesn't need to level :P], and proceeding one large step closer to 
getting the true ending of the game.</p>
<p>Whatever the heck you decide to do, after handling the matter with Cell, 
there's not much to do for now, so go back to the tent and return to the machine 
in the hidden underground room. Step on it to teleport back to the present, 
where if you need to, you can go back to Nemadonus, which we suggest you do...</p>
<p><u><b>6. The Forest of Illusions</b></u></p>
<p><u>6A. Taking Care of a Wooden Construct -</u> At Nemadonus, switch your group in 
for Marcus, Plo, Bonnie and Flaid. Remember what the piano girl said about 
Janepo Illusion Forest? It's time to go there at last! If you speak to her again 
now, she'll congratulate you for finding Cell, then she'll mention of a new 
visitor from the present that's arrived in the future timeline. This objective 
does not have to be completed immediately, and for now, we'll let it rest. Also 
remember, when on Nemadonus, using the Polymorph Amulet[or hitting '4'] will ask 
if you want to teleport back to your last location. This is a quick way back to 
where you just came from. Either way, make your way to the forest east of the 
fence at the waterfalls where you had met Flaid[or Marcus if on EXTREMELY Hard] 
and you'll notice if you have the right four members that one of the trees looks 
like it was cut down and only a stump remains. Bump up against this stump and 
you'll be teleported into the Illusion Forest.</p>
<p>Now that you're in the forest, the animals will start blabbing about 
something odd that they sense in the forest, so you should definitely look 
around. Be warned, this forest is somewhat of a maze and there are a few dead 
ends. The best method is to head down the right/upper paths, fighting the 
various monster parties with varying amounts of old enemies, plus new ones, such 
as the Possessed Oaks and the Werewolves which can make things a bit annoying, 
since your characters will likely have contrasting levels to each other. At one 
point near the top right-most reachable area of the forest, you should see 2 
oriental looking containers. These carry varying amounts of Bottle Rockets and 
Malak Shards depending on the difficulty level. From here, you need to start 
going left, keeping in the upper part of the map, although you will likely need 
to go down one south path and then turn left at the intersection. After going up 
and left more, you should find this odd wooden creature coming in at you fast. 
Once he touches you, you'll go into battle with him, revealing he is Woodman, 
another Robot Master like Shadowman, and he speaks that he will cut you to 
ribbons in the name of his mistress[sound familiar folks? :P]. Marcus's 
Metal/Shadow Blades[and Wave Burner if he defeated Frieza one-on-one] work 
extremely well on him, but he tends to be resistance to water and ice. He can 
also use his Leaf Shield attack[both on himself to strengthen him, or throw it 
at the entire party which can inflict several conditions and do damage] against 
you, so watch your back. When he falls, the forest will shake, and Marcus will 
gain the ability to use Leaf Shield Summon and Leaf Shield Throw. Also, the 
trees in the south part of the clearing you met him in will vanish, and you can 
now head down this way.</p>
<p><u>6B. The Cold Centaur and the Strange Orb -</u> As you head down this way, around 
halfway, you should come upon two peculiar things. One is that there is an 
opening in the trees to your left. The second is that there is a strange 
creature walking around. You should go into the opening first. There are two 
small tombstones here, and a brown chest here. Opening it first will pit you 
against a varying group of Cyberdemons[or ghosts on the harder difficulties]. 
Second it will give you a high amount of coins, and then third, it puts you 
against a stronger Cyberdemon group[with some Supers thrown in for bad measure 
&gt;_&lt;]. After beating this, you'll get at least 4 'Extremes Vests'[on Easy, you'll 
get 4 addition 'Extremes Caps', and on Very Easy, you'll get 8 of both types of 
item :P]. These items are equippable on the animals, and each item increases 
their elemental resistances by 1 level, so having both the Cap and Vest on each 
character is a considerable increase in elemental resistances[except Typeless]. 
Now go back out of the opening, and find the strange creature[which you might 
recognize if you've played a certain SNES RPG in the past]. You'll learn this is 
a Mr. Saturn from the game EarthBound, and he is a special shop that sells some 
of the stronger claw items in the game. He sells Bubsy Claws[one of which you 
win as well from Woodman] and Frieza Claws. The Bubsy Claw is a little weaker 
than a Frieza Claw, BUT it allows the attacker to hit all enemies when they 
slash with it. Having one of each on all four animals is a pristine idea, so if 
you have any unused Malak Shards, sell them properly to afford getting the 
necessary claws for each animal. Just remember, both types of claw are 
expensive. </p>
<p>When you're done, proceed south through the cleared trees, until you reach an 
intersection going down and then right. Go down the RIGHT path and then up and 
right to find another clearing, bigger than the one you found Woodman in. In the 
middle of this clearing is a trash can-like thing, and it's pacing in place. Now 
note, you could've gone to this area earlier, but it's best suggested to ice 
Woody before doing so, due to the EXP he gives when you beat him. Check this 
trash can, and you'll get barked at by what looks like a Centaur, and you'll 
enter battle with him. However when the battle field appears, you'll notice this 
ain't any normal Centaur. He's blue skinned, and in gold armor, with a gold 
shield. This creature is the elusive 'Gold Centaur' of recent myth and legend. 
These creatures are said to be an evolved Centaur that has also broken the 
control of Korax's powers and it owes no allegiance to any but it's own species. 
Also, you're in for it, since this particular one has the Reflect status on it 
for some reason. DO NOT use skills that target the Centaur. They only get 
deflected back at you, so your best bet is to use any stat up powers and make 
your attack as high as possible and use physical attacks, or use items like the 
Rand Pendant[which cannot be reflected]. Once he falls, you gain an Ancient 
Capsule, and an additional 4 Goddess Ribbons and a Shielding Sigil[the source of 
his Reflect status during the battle], or if you're on easier skills, 2+ 
Shielding Sigils, and maybe even Megami Ribbons. He will then go away, turning 
back into a trashcan, which is now dormant. </p>
<p>From the Gold Centaur's position, go further east and then north to find 
another cleared area of trees. Within this clearing is a strange amber-colored 
orb with 4 strange stars in it. When you examine it, you'll teleport it to 
Nemadonus. Now, leave the forest[you can't use the Amulet in the forest] and 
then Polymorph to Nemadonus and talk to the Piano Girl. You'll also notice a new 
stairwell is here, and if you go down it, you'll see Vegeta has moved down into 
this room, and you'll see the sphere you recently picked up. If you take to 
Vegeta, he says he can't believe you found a 'Dragonball', and he'll also offer 
you to 'spar' with him. Ignore him for now, and go back to the piano girl, and 
talk to her. Again, she'll tell you you've found a 'Dragonball', one of 7 
spheres of energy on the planet that if gathered in one place, can summon an 
'Eternal Dragon' that can grant a number of wishes depending on the type of 
dragon. You'll also learn that Tara wants to use a wish now to bring Clyde back 
from the dead. However you have the problem of finding where the other 6 
Dragonballs are at, so get out there looking for them. You can change your group 
if you really want, but I normally keep using the animals to search, since they 
did technically find the first Dragonball.</p>
<p><u><b>7. The Dragonball Hunt</b></u></p>
<p><u>7A. The Six Star Dragonball -</u> Now, from outside of Janepo Illusion Forest, 
going right should lead you back to the caves near Janepo Ninja Castle. Go back 
into the cave, and you'll instantly spot the Six-Star Dragonball in the middle 
of all those pushable rocks. All you need to do is clear the rocks around it 
away to get it.</p>
<p><u>7B. The Seven Star Dragonball -</u> From the pushable rocks in the cave, go back 
and enter the path to Winnowing Hall. Roam through the cave until you spot the 
Seven-Star Dragonball in a nook closer to the end of the path. It's easy 
pickings to get this ball.</p>
<p><u>7C. The One Star Dragonball -</u> Teleport back to Janepo Upper Cliffs[where you 
started the game]. At the top of the ladder leading down to the Janepo Lower 
Cliffs is the One-Star Dragonball, out in the open. Pick it up.</p>
<p><u>7E. The Two Star Dragonball -</u> From the ladder, head down to the lower cliffs, 
and them grapple up into the inner cliffs. Go right and up the steps to the 
second floor of the sunken castle, then down until you're back in the first 
floor, near the books and where the first drainage switch was. There should be 
the Two-Star Dragonball sitting here just waiting for you to pick it up, so do 
so.</p>
<p><u>7D. The Five Star Dragonball -</u> Go back to the inner cliffs, and head to 
Zarbon's throne room. The Five-Star ball is a few spaces south of his throne, so 
pick it up. Easy as cake.</p>
<p><u>7F. The Three Star Dragonball -</u> Go back to the Janepo Ninja Castle Dungeons, 
and head to the southern section of the dungeon. You'll notice a rope is hanging 
along the middle wall and the main wall above it is cleared, and that there is 
now a brown chest in the middle of the room at the top. Go there and open the 
chest. You'll be confronted by a Zombie Baron[much harder than a normal Baron of 
Hell], then you'll get a Quad Damage MK. II next time. Then opening it once more 
reveals a strange gas-pump like creature that you enter battle with. The 
'Fission Pump' has 95,000 HP, and is immune to all elementals except Typeless, 
Blade, Blunt and Noise. Noise is actually its' weakness, so if Marcus defeated 
Frieza earlier and has Noise Crusher, it will work the best against this guy. As 
it loses health, it uses stronger types of Bottle Rockets against you, including 
the 'Fission B. Rocket'[hence the name 'Fission Pump'] which is a powerful 
rocket that hits the whole enemy party and can inflict varying types of 
Poison-based ailments on them. Upon it's defeat, the chest remains, and you'll 
get a Fission B. Rocket. Check the chest one last time and say 'Yes' the chest 
will TRANSFORM into the Three-Star Dragonball, which you can now safely claim. 
If you got all seven Dragonballs, a message will pop up, telling you of it, and 
that you need to teleport to Nemadonus. Choose to remove your group and put Tara 
in as the first person[#11 at the input screen].</p>
<p><u><b>8. Clyde Can be Saved!</b></u></p>
<p><u>8A. A Twist to the Dragonballs? -</u> At this point, take Tara over to the room 
with the Dragonballs and Vegeta in it in the house. At this point, if you want 
to gain some optional stuff, see &quot;Vegeta's Sparring Section&quot; below in the 
Optional Quests section. Go down to the center Dragonball and check it. It will 
ask you if you want to summon the Cronos Dragon. Hit yes, and Tara will ask 
Vegeta if there's anything specific they might need to do here. He tells her that 
there might be a type of password to the Dragonballs, and that finding a 
Namekian would be a wise choice before attempting the summon. He will 
automatically join you. Go back upstairs and talk to the Piano Girl. She will 
tell you, much to Vegeta's shock, that the Namekians did NOT make the 
Dragonballs on Cronos, nor do they live on the world. When asked who did make 
them, the girl tells Tara and Vegeta the Mr. Saturn tribe on Cronos holds that 
responsibility. Tara remembers the Saturns from a time between both of Quake's 
attacks where Paula and the chosen ones took her and her friends to meet the 
Earth Saturn Tribes. She then remembers that there was a Saturn in the Janepo 
Illusion Forest. Go back to the forest by leaving Nemadonus, and have Tara use 
her Teleport skill for a quick warp into the forest. You'll end up in the 
clearing were Woodman was defeated, with the trees south of you still clear. Go 
down and find the Saturn shop. When given the option, &quot;Ask Him about 
Dragonballs&quot; will lead you to learn from the Saturn that there is an 'Elder' 
that lives on the highest of the Janepo Cliffs, and that he would know how to 
use them. Leave the forest, and head to the Upper Cliffs[be it by walking or 
Teleport], and you'll now see a bridge leading across part of the cliffs, and 
some ropes coming down the walls on the other side. Climb up the ropes, and go 
all the way to the left most ladder. Here you will see a lone Mr. Saturn at a 
Piano at the cliff peak. Talk to him to learn that he can speak more human than 
the other Saturns, and that he is both aware of Quake, and the startling news 
that Clyde is not dead, but merely 'lost'. Tara will obviously be confused to 
this, and the elder explains Clyde did not die at the hands of a Shambler, but 
had actually opened a rift on top of them both that lead to another realm, and 
killed the Shambler afterwards, but ending up lost in the realm. He tells Tara 
the Dragonballs can still bring him back to her and her friends, if Clyde agrees 
to be taken back. He asks you to teleport him to Nemadonus, and both the elder 
and you will automatically be teleported back into the Dragonball room on 
Nemadonus.</p>
<p><u>8B. Marcus M.'s Wife, Joleena -</u> Talk to the elder here, and he'll tell you 
that you should find Tara's mother, Rachel, and bring her to Nemadonus before 
they attempt to bring Clyde back. The objectives menu will say that Marcus M. 
might know how to find Rachel, so go to him[making sure to have room to add him 
to the group], and speak to him. He'll ask to see the Elder to confirm of 
Clyde's really being alive, so he'll join you as you go back to the elder. Talk 
to the elder, and Marcus M. will reveal that he doesn't know where Rachel might 
be, but he has a hunch that his wife, Joleena would know, but that she is 
currently working at a castle to the north of Tara's house on Earth, known as 
Jeremiah Castle. The game will shift perspective and show you the area the 
castle is, then will go back to you. You'll notice it's west of Clyde's 
tombstone and the Tower of Life, so it's not too far away. Now you can make your 
way to Earth[their are several ways: one is to teleport to Tara's Garden, 
another is to use the portal glass on top of the small cliff on Nemadonus[inside 
the cave, go left at the first turn and leave the cave. The glass leads to just 
outside the Tower of Life], or you can go back through Winnowing Hall and the 
Tower of Life].</p>
<p><u><b>9. Find Rachel Immediately!</b></u></p>
<p><u>9A. The Mysterious Boys -</u> Once on Earth, you can walk to Clyde's Tombstone, 
for Tara to remove the death date from it[optional, but can benefit Clyde later 
when he joins you]. Then you can go to Jeremiah Castle. Talk to the Guardess and 
she'll move aside and let you through. As you move north, you'll see that a 
massive section of the castle is blocking the direct path, so you must go around 
by turning right. You'll notice various people working on the wall, including a 
couple of robots. As you turn right, you need to take note of the boy in front 
of the mirror. He is revealed to be 'Alex', someone who may or may not appear 
familiar to you as a player. Either way, turn north to find another boy behind 
the counter here, selling various items, including several Sigils of various 
types. Buy anything from him, and he'll be revealed as 'Vernon', who also may or 
may not seem familiar to you. He will ask that you give Alex this one gift box 
from him. You'll receive the gift box. Take it back to Alex, and watch the 
results. One of four things may happen. One, he may take it and get 300,000 
coins. Two, he may take it and get a pie in his face. Three, he may refuse it 
and you'll get 300,000 coins instead. Or Four, he'll refuse it, and you'll 
almost get pied in the face instead. Either way, after this is all said and 
done, go left first when you come to the intersection past the wall. Go around 
to the guard-girl working on the wall, named Lilah, and she'll tell you Joleena 
is working way in the back of the castle, and Marcus M. will reveal Joleena has 
Amazon strength in her, thus her being back there, working on some bigger work. 
Go north down the main intersection. So the map will shake at various intervals. 
The Agent sitting on the throne will tell you that Joleena is responsible for 
the noise and the shaking. The green-haired, darker skinned woman in the back 
jumping around near the wall is Joleena, but if you try to talk to her then and 
there, she won't react. So what's a eager player to do you might ask? Go to the 
rope on the wall east of her, and pull it to ring the bell. It'll snap Joleena 
out of her work for a few moments. You must talk to her before she goes back to 
beating up the walls behind her, or you'll have to ring the bell again. Talk to 
Joleena, and if Don's there, she'll call him a cutey, saying he sorta reminds 
her of her and Marcus M. Marcus M. will tell her Quake has returned, much to her 
anger. He tells her that while he isn't on Earth, that he is striking from Don's 
world of Cronos. Joleena quickly decides Quake's defeat is much more important 
than her job, but before doing so, tells you to back up a few steps, saying 
she's going to quickly finish her last job before going. Marcus M. will warn 
everyone she's going to rush the wall, to her sarcastic amusement. Joleena then 
smashes into the wall, breaking it apart. Don will be amazed if he's present, 
and she will then follow you down to where the Agent had gone to when Marcus M. 
had given a warning. Marcus M. explains that another Marcus is up on Nemadonus, 
as well as Flaid, and gives her a Polymorph Amulet. Joleena will then teleport 
to Nemadonus, now a playable character[and one of the strongest physically as 
well :D]. You can also now return to Nemadonus as well.</p>
<p><u>9B. Rachel the Hermit -</u> At Nemadonus, talk to Joleena inside the house. 
She'll realize you're looking for Rachel, and that you are aiming to bring Clyde 
back to this realm. She'll mention that she has learned of Rachel's location, 
and has even visited her on occasion, but had been asked to keep her whereabouts 
a secret for various reasons. Joleena will mention of the Caplino Badlands[and 
you'll get an idea of where on the world map of Earth it is], a breeding ground 
for various monsters from the past war against Quake to give them their own 
place to roam, and that Rachel is living on a small island to the northeast of 
the badlands, and that there is an underground path between the badlands and the 
island that can be used to get there. She joins you, telling you she might need 
to be there to explain the situation to Rachel. Now take Tara, Joleena and any 
other two characters, and head back to Earth, likely via Polymorph Amulet. From 
the castle, go to just south of the Tower of Life. You'll see a bush with a 
pointer blinking over it. Check it for the Badlands Key, which will allow you to 
enter and leave the badlands at will[if you try to go there without the key, you 
won't be able to enter]. To leave to the world map, go east, and then north 
where the path over the water becomes apparent. Walk north on the map until you 
reach the badlands, and enter.</p>
<p>Now that you're in the Badlands, remember this: battles will occur here, and 
they will occur A LOT, regardless of the difficulty level. Battles tend to occur 
almost every 6-11 steps on Normal level, however the good side is that about 
every one of these battles are against foes you've faced before, many of them 
being weaker level foes[even the possessed guards from Janepo Ninja Castle 
appear, as well as Cacodemons, Barons of Hell and Cyberdemons, although recent 
enemies like Possessed Oaks and Werewolves can appear too]. However it can get 
annoying very fast in this area despite the easy battles. The main thing you 
need to do first is head north east until you come to a cliff face with both a 
fence, and a Cyberdemon blocking it. When you check the Cyberdemon, you'll find 
it is dormant, and will not attack you, but it will not move, so you must find a 
means to remove it from your path. One of the secondary objectives will now 
mention to look for the Cacodemons floating around randomly in the Badlands, and 
that Tara can speak in this hiss-like language. Roughly 10 Cacodemons roam the 
badlands, and most of them will either bark at you to leave them alone, or fight 
you[easy as heck]. One will even drop Soul Spheres if you defeat him. One of 
them will say &quot;What do you want?!&quot;. This Cacodemon will give you some bonus 
money and a Chthon's Fang if you talk to him a certain amount of times [75 on 
Normal, 30+ on Very Easy], and this can be done over and over to get money and 
Chthon Fangs, and doing this at least twice will reward you Bonnie's Forcefield 
spell. One Cacodemon will also respond to Tara, and will tell you that Rachel 
put that Cyberdemon in the way intentionally to keep people out of the caves, 
but he will mention that a strange blue-haired woman dropped a strange 
capsule-sized item that can turn into a crane, which can remove the Cyberdemon. 
If Vegeta is present at this moment, he'll think about a 'woman' that he knows. 
Either way, go back to the Cyberdemon, and check him now to use the crane to 
remove him. Once he has been placed to the side, you'll notice he is still 
deactivated, and you can walk into the caves.</p>
<p><u>9C. The Maze and Meeting Rachel -</u> In this maze-like cave, be prepared to 
fight more Zombie Barons, and now also some Zombie Cacodemons[stronger than 
regular Cacodemons] as you make your way through. To get to the exit the 
quickest, go directly north until you can go north no longer, then  right, 
then up, then right, then up, and then LEFT when the halls are wider looking. 
You should come to an area with light at the end, where the exit is. To find an 
option quest, go to &quot;The Kelbeross&quot;[below].</p>
<p>The cave will dump you on a small island with a house just a square south of 
you. This is Rachel's hidden abode. Go in, and you'll notice she is well 
sustained on her own, having an ATM machine[which you can't use just yet] in the 
front center room, a computer and some pizza in the room to the left, some 
accommodations at the back of the house for unexpected guests, and a kitchen and a 
bed room to the right in the front room. You'll notice another pointer over a 
bed in the bed room[which even has a TV in it! :P]. If you check it, Joleena 
will mention that Rachel must be out on an errand, and will return eventually, 
and that resting will likely pass the waiting time, so you'll take a nap and 
recover automatically. After you wake up, Rachel will walk[or jog] into the 
bedroom, seeing Joleena, but not Tara at first. Upon seeing Tara there, Rachel 
almost freaks out at Joleena for telling Tara where she was hiding, but Tara 
tells Rachel that she urgently needed to see her, and Rachel calms down, and 
lets Tara continue. She tells Rachel first that Quake has returned, but before 
she can get all of it out, Rachel freaks out again, cursing Quake for Clyde's 
'death' and getting very worried about Tara's well being since her heroic spirit 
is inherited from Clyde, and she runs off and collides into a wall, knocking 
some sense into her, before Joleena and Tara calm her down. </p>
<p>Tara explains that Quake isn't on Earth, and Rachel wonders how they know 
Quake has returned then, and Tara reveals the entity is on Cronos, much to 
Rachel's horror, as she then tells Tara that Quake is likely collecting energy 
from the remaining essence of the slain Korax, and that it might be making him 
stronger. Tara breaks Rachel out of her doom-like mood by mentioning that Clyde 
can be returned to them, making Rachel's mood take a near 180. Rachel is 
ecstatic, but is reluctant to get too directly involved at first. Tara is curious 
to why Rachel left again after Quake's first defeat. Rachel explains that over 
the 7 years she and Clyde were gone from Tara's life that Plo, Bonnie, Marcus M. 
and Joleena had become her family, and that she felt a balance had been 
established between all of them during the years. After believing Clyde died 
after the first fight with Quake, Rachel felt convinced that trying to return 
into Tara's life as her real mother would just break the balance and 
coordination she felt Tara already gained, and that she wouldn't be a good 
mother then. She then tells of how she always believed herself a curse to her 
friends since childhood. Tara and Joleena attempt to convince her otherwise, and 
that with Clyde's return they can all still be a big happy family. Rachel 
decides that all things are worth a chance, and also says she'll join the 
impending battle with Quake again. Tara gives Rachel a Polymorph Amulet, and 
Rachel teleports to Nemadonus, becoming the next playable character. Now follow 
Rachel back to Nemadonus, swapping everyone out, and re-adding just Tara by 
herself to the party. It's time to bring Clyde back to us! XD</p>
<p><u><b>10. Clyde's Return! The Arrival of the Chosen.</b></u></p>
<p><u>10A. Timon, the Eternal Dragon of Cronos -</u> Now on Nemadonus again, try to 
remember which character[s] have a Frieza Sigil equipped[if Tara herself doesn't 
already have it equipped]. Find that person and add them, and de-equip their 
Frieza Sigil and equip it on Tara, then put that character back. Just make sure 
Tara has a Frieza Sigil equipped at this point. It will help matters a lot for 
what's to come. Now go back to the elder and talk to him, he'll say it's time to 
summon the dragon. The scene will fade out and fade back in on the outer 
northeast cliffs of Nemadonus, where the seven Dragonballs, Tara, the other 
characters acquired to this point, and the elder are all about to summon the 
Dragon. The Elder will call out to the dragon, identifying it as 'Timon'. Don 
will recognize the name and interrupt the elder, asking him if the 'Timon' he 
speaks of has any connection to the one of the Hexen Wars, who had bearded axes 
for the Legion's warriors with his namesake. The Elder confirms that he is the 
same Timon as from the wars, and that the ascended into a great entity for his 
efforts in the war against Korax, and that the Saturn Tribe had been given 
permission to convert him into an eternal dragon. The elder continues his 
summons, and the sky turns dark and the balls starting glowing, as a large 
dragon appears in the skies above everyone. Timon speaks, revealing that the 
Earth Dragonballs are slowly turning dark, and becoming tainted. Vegeta is 
amazed at Timon's knowledge. Timon also recognizes Vegeta, telling him that even 
with the wishes being used for good needs, that negative energy is amassing into 
the Earth DBs. After all of this, he asks for his first wish. Tara asks him if 
he can bring Clyde, her father, back to this plane and to their very spot. After 
a small pause of thought, Timon confirms his ability to do so, but he says it 
will be a bit complicated in her case, to Tara's dismay. Timon reveals that 
anyone not native to Cronos that attempts to use the Dragonballs must fight him 
first to prove themselves worthy of their wish, or have a native from Cronos 
present make the same wish in that person's place. He also says that the matter 
with Quake has another possible solution, but Tara will have to defeat him to 
get info on that as well. Don will then interlude here, telling Tara that Timon 
is very strong. If Flaid has reached Level 99 already, he mentions that Timon 
can also use Ultima as one of his spells, and offers that he can make the wish 
instead. You are now given the choice to fight Timon for the wish rights, or let 
Don make the wish.</p>
<p>Now, this info on another solution to Quake sounds promising enough, right? I 
hope it does, because it counts a lot towards the TRUE ending of the game down 
the road. Also, there's this feeling in Tara's intuition that something else 
will happen if she wins. So because of this, we're choosing to fight Timon. The 
following battle is one-on-one. Have Tara use Nulnuke if she has it on her first 
turn, and then Enlighten if she also has it. This makes her chances of winning 
far, far greater. Timon has 75,000 HP, and his attack list depends on Tara's 
level as well. At Level 99[which is usually where Tara is by now on my games], 
he'll be able to use Kealga[about 9,999 HP per use recovered], PK Dynamo 
Omega[which against Tara is actually USELESS, since she HEALS from Thunder by 
now anyways XD], the Koudo Genki Dama, PK Exa Omega[which is one reason you 
should use Nulnuke once], or Ultima[again, another reason to use Nulnuke]. If he 
is brought below 7,500 HP and manages to get a turn, he'll escape[you'll still 
win, but you won't get the Ethereal Crossbow he has if you defeated him 
completely]. With all of the above[Frieza Sigil, Enlighten, All Up, Nulnuke], 
Tara should be able to hit Timon 5-6 times per each of his turns if she has no 
need to heal herself. However, he has no specific weaknesses at all. ALL 
Elementals[INCLUDING Typeless] do only 50% damage to him. If Tara has any 
Dis[spell] moves, they can be of help here too. Disshock is a good one, since I 
use PK Dynamo Gamma on him often. Either way, once you beat him, Timon will 
congratulate Tara's efforts. He'll start off by telling you that despite Quake's 
close proximity to Korax's essence, he isn't absorbing enough of it to make a 
real difference. He then tells Tara that while Quake may not be killable, it 
doesn't mean he can't be CONTAINED, and not necessarily just by the Dead Zone 
either by what he says. He tells Tara that an old 'friend' carries an item that 
can help lead to a more permanent victory over Quake, but he does not know who 
the friend is, that or he doesn't wish to give away too much info. Tara will 
wonder which 'friend' he speaks of, and then she will suddenly get a powerful 
boost to her stats. She gains 1250 HP, 75 TP, 15 Attack, 20 Defense, 10 Mind, 15 
Speed, AND she will be upgraded in other ways[her titles changes from 'Kid 
Heroine' to 'Teen Heroine', and her class is now 'Magi Lv. 1', and she now has 
absorbencies against both Holy AND Dark, much akin to Rachel[and Clyde as 
well]]. Timon will now wish Clyde back to your realm, and your current location.</p>
<p><u>10B. The Arrival of the Four -</u> Once Clyde appears, he is confused and 
somewhat disoriented by his trip to you, but Tara will run up and hug him much 
like the young little girl she really is, being reunited with her lost father at 
last. Clyde will learn of Quake's return as a threat to the universe, and that 
even Rachel has returned. Clyde will take notice of Rachel, Plo, Bonnie, Marcus 
M., and Joleena, and then Don's group, and will be surprised at the seriousness 
of the situation. Don will then meekly interrupt them, realizing there is still 
one wish left, and that he doesn't want to keep Timon waiting. Timon is grateful 
for the attention, but tells everyone he is a much more patient dragon than 
Shenron or Porunga are, and that he actually wishes he could be out longer than 
he is. Don now has the option of choose one of four choices for a wish. All of 
them are stat boosts that affect ALL TWENTY-THREE characters in the 
game[including future and secret characters]. One is +500 HP, another is +375 
TP, a third +250 HP AND TP, and a fourth being +128 HP, +48 TP, +32 Attack, +32 
Defense, +32 Mind and +32 Speed to all members. The most useful are either +250 
HP/TP or the  wish that affects all stats. Usually I choose the latter, but 
it's up to you. Timon will grant the wish, and take his leave. The Cronos 
Dragonballs turn to stone[but don't scatter like most Dragonballs do], and Don 
suggests taking Clyde inside to rest.</p>
<p>Tara agrees, but she suddenly senses something coming towards them. Vegeta 
confirms her statement and says FOUR somethings are coming. If Cell is here, 
he'll mention that 'they' didn't die from the disease after all. Vegeta will be 
confused, until you suddenly see four new people crash onto Nemadonus in front 
of everyone as if it were commonplace. Cell will confirm what he first thought 
was right, and Vegeta will wonder who they are. Tara and Cell confirm that these 
four are the 'Chosen Four', the four teenage heroes who were said to fight and 
defeated one of the most powerful evils known to creation, the Embodiment of 
Evil known as Giygas. Tara will greet them, among which one is her cousin Paula. 
They greet her back, before Zarbon about freaks out at their presence and 
demands to know why they're here. Tara calms him down and confirms their 
identity, and then reveals Ness, Paula and Poo possess a form of teleportation 
that transcends dimensions to reach their destinations[similar to how a 
Polymorph Amulet teleports people to and from Nemadonus], explaining their 
arrival. Paula tells them the four sensed Tara to Nemadonus and eventually 
followed them. The four chosen learn of Quake's return, and also get 
confirmation from Rachel of Quake's plan. The four of them also in addition join 
you here, as the screen will fade back into the house. You now should have 19 
characters total[20 if you got Cell earlier]. Also, you will be told that you 
now have an 'ATM Card'[Ness had this when he joined you, so you now get to use 
it], and that you can use it to Deposit or Withdraw money from ATM machines[like 
the one you found in Rachel's little abode, and Ness's account even has some 
extra money in it from the start, so this is a plus :D].</p>
<p><u><b>11. Final Preparations</b></u></p>
<p><u>11A. The Strange Dog in the Future -</u> Alright, now from here, the first thing 
you need to do is sorta backtrack. Go to the Piano Girl and talk to her just so 
you realize there is still one major thing you need to do, and that's our little 
matter with another visitor from our time in Cell's timeline. We're finally 
gonna go back and find out what's going on. YAY! XD</p>
<p>Go back to the tent, suggesting you take Flaid at the very least, maybe Tara 
and Don, and some other character in the process. Go back to the tent at the 
waterfalls and use the time machine in the basement. From the tent in the 
future, head back to where the Ninja Girl who informed you about Cell is. Amidst 
the darkness of the skies, you may now notice there is a rope along parts of the 
small ledge in this area. Go up the shorter one, and go left and up, being taken 
to an area you haven't been before, where you can begin to see part of the 
castle front yard in the distance. You'll see this strange-looking dog pacing 
around here. Go up and speak to him. He won't initially say much, instead you'll 
go into battle with him.</p>
<p>Do note, you can lose here without getting a game over, but you have to 
defeat him to go any further in the game, so be ready. At first, he uses mainly 
fire-elemental attacks, and is weak to thunder elemental attacks. After 
weakening him so much, he'll tell you he will go into his true nature, hoping 
you'll be able to defeat him and 'learn the truth'. Now his elemental properties 
flip. He now uses Thunder Elemental attacks and is weak to Fire-elemental ones. 
Upon defeating him, he tells you that you're ready to learn the truth. He 
explains that the dormant, incorporeal state Quake was in 2 years ago in his 
first battle with Tara was a dormant ploy for the most part. The dog claims that 
Quake alone can easily do more damage than his minions can. He tells that Cell's 
time didn't feel the full effect of Quake's power since Cell killed Shaft before 
it could happen. He tells you the only way to truly defeat Quake is to send him 
through a much stronger Dead Zone gate that can keep other immortals out, only 
then can the universe be safe from Quake. He says you must get as strong as 
possible before even attempting to find Quake. He tells you not to worry about 
finding him, and that Quake will make his presence and the path to him known 
when HE feels you're ready to find him. The dog then says he must leave soon, 
and gives you a &quot;Sword of Truth&quot;[Tara/Paula], and 5 Malak Shards. If Flaid is 
there, he'll ask the dog if he is somehow related to him and Bonnie, but the 
strange dog tells Flaid not to worry about his 'destiny in life', and he 
abruptly leaves, seemingly in a hurry. After everything is said and done, you 
can check your Mandatory Objectives. You learn you need to get your characters 
all to level 99[except Cell, who has only 1 level to begin with :P], before 
Quake will likely make himself known to you. On Easy, you need to get everyone 
to level 88 or above. On Very Easy, they need to be at least all level 77 or 
higher.</p>
<p>11B. Getting as Strong as Possible - The most effective known ways to get all 
the characters to their required levels are to now accomplish &quot;The Forsaken 
Martial Artist&quot; optional quest[below], or to gather people who are NOT level 99 
and take them to the future and fight Molecules until they all reach level 99. 
When all of the 19 required characters reach or exceed the required levels, the 
game will automatically transition to the intro screen for Part 5, ending Part 
4.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Part 5: The Quake Begins</font></b></p>
<p><b><u>1. Old Enemies Come Back</u></b></p>
<p><u>1A. Frieza and the Ginyu Force -</u> Once Part 5 starts, the screen returns you 
to where you were when you had attained the last of the requirements back in 
Part 4, and you'll hear bells, accompanied by an 'ALERT' that tells you the 
barrier on the second floor of the Sunken Castle is down, and when you check 
your Mandatory objectives, you'll find out this is where Quake's remote hiding 
place is. It's time to pay him a house call. Now head to the second floor of 
that castle, and go past where the wall is. There is an opening to the very 
right of where the wall is, but all it leads to is another locked Gray chest 
which has the name 'Ionic' on it. This is a dead end for now, so go back and 
head north from the collapsed barrier. You'll need to be weary of fights here, 
because you got both Zombie Barons and Zombie Cacodemons, in addition to Zombie 
CYBERDEMONS now to deal with as common foes. Also, you can be pitted against 
'clone' enemies of various characters that can mimic their strongest attacks. 
All clones drop a type of Sphere when they die, so there is a plus to fighting 
them, and one is almost a guaranteed level 99 to any future character in the 
game[not that it matters now -_-;]. When you get north enough, turn right and 
head down to find a very unpleasant surprise waiting for you. It looks like 
Frieza has been revived, and he appears to have 5 goons accompanying him. You 
can't walk around them, so you're forced to have to fight them to move on to the 
exit behind and around the corner from them. However, chances are when you speak 
to him, he mention that you're the 'fools' who helped Zarbon or Marcus kill him, 
and that he doesn't want to waste his time with unworthy adversaries. He tells 
you that you need to bring Zarbon and Vegeta to him, and also Cell if you found 
him, and if you defeated him with Marcus in the past to take the cat to him as 
well. This means you have little variety with what characters will end up facing 
him, especially if you beat him with Marcus AND got Cell to join you[you will 
HAVE to have Marcus, Zarbon, Vegeta and Cell to fight him, else he'll just 
complain more]. Once the correct characters are present, you'll get into a 
bantering contest with Frieza and his 'elite' Ginyu Force[the five clowns behind 
him]. If Marcus defeated Frieza, many of the Ginyus will insult Marcus to the 
end, saying he will die horribly for defying Frieza. However one person is worth 
importance to listen to. Jeice, the white haired, orange skinned dude, is mad 
more at Zarbon than anything else, saying he 'betrayed' everyone, and demands to 
know why. Frieza says that it doesn't matter and that it's time they 
exterminated your group. A MAJOR battle begins now. </p>
<p>Now, the following can be either somewhat easy, or it can be extremely 
agitating depending on your intentions, because all five Ginyus start the 
battle with some variation of Regen status[1/4, 3/8, 1/2, 3/4, etc] Also, there 
is no true hint towards this, but this is another crucial point in the game. I 
will list the two ways most people go about this fight:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">A. Easier, But Least Satisfying Way:</font> Use stat-raising spells, especially 
speed raising spells. Marcus and Cell are likely your best chance at this. Use 
Dark and Typeless against Ginyu and kill him first. Then use Thunder and Water 
spells on Baata second. Noise and Holy work best against Rikoom[especially Noise 
Crusher]. Typeless is really the only way to do considerable damage to Jeice, so 
use it, and the same applies to Gurudo as well. Frieza is more vulnerable to 
Blunt and Typeless than anything else. When you smack off enough HP on Frieza, 
he curses at you and transforms to 100% power once again[again he also has the 
100% status]. Now, many of his resistances increase, but one actually WEAKENS. 
Guess which one? If you don't realize it, use all TYPELESS spells to do the 
worst damage to Frieza[he actually becomes weak to them at 100%]. He should 
finally go down, and the match will be over. Of course, you can use Typeless on 
everyone in the enemy group to help weaken them all at once, but due to the 
Ginyus' Regen-like statuses, it tends to take much longer trying to use spells 
that hit them all at once.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">B. Harder, But Most Beneficial Way:</font> At first, it's similar to the first way. 
Take Ginyu out the same way, take Baata out the same way, and the same with 
Rikoom. However IGNORE AND DON'T KILL Jeice in this fight, despite his threat 
level, and attack Gurudo until he's gone. Now you can slam on Frieza until he 
goes to 100% and starts fighting with a vengeance. Now from here, use Typeless 
spells[making sure not to accidentally kill Jeice here], and lower Frieza to 
within 25% of his health. At this point, Jeice will bark at Zarbon again in the 
middle of the fight, and will ask him about his betrayal again. Zarbon replies 
that he didn't betray them, but that FRIEZA betrayed both of them[Jeice is 
Kerda-jin, like Zarbon]. He mentions of Kerda-sei and how Frieza had lied about 
the planet being atomized by the solar winds. Frieza growls at Zarbon, saying 
royalty has it good, able to talk big crap without normally having to back it 
up, and hits Zarbon a couple of times. Zarbon continues his verbal attack on 
Frieza, telling Jeice that Frieza was responsible for giving the order that led 
to Kerda's destruction. Jeice will ask Frieza if this is true, and Frieza will 
at first deny it. However Jeice isn't as dependant anymore as in the past, and 
figures out that Zarbon's words are hauntingly true and accuses Frieza of using 
his men like mere 'tools', him having been too lazy in the past to do his own 
work, despite his difference in power to even his best minion[Ginyu]. Frieza 
commends Jeice for learning on his own, but than hits him with a mortal attack, 
bringing Jeice to the brink of death. However the Kerda-jin has a final ace, and 
uses the spell of Ultimara on Frieza, blasting him from the fight, and causing 
it to end.</p>
<p>If Jeice defeated Frieza here, there is some additional action here, as Jeice 
is slowly dying, and so is Frieza from their last blow trading contest. Frieza 
manages to fire out one last barrage of energy, aimed at your group, but Jeice 
flings himself in the way and blocks it instead[how selfless of him :P], and he 
ends up dying from it. However, Frieza curses Jeice's intervention, that last 
barrage of energy having been the LAST of his power, and he dies, turning into a 
dormant specter where he stands. Zarbon will mourn Jeice's death, but Vegeta 
will have to interrupt, telling him a surprising truth: Vegeta did find out that 
he had been order to destroy Kerda-sei before their battle on Namek, but didn't 
tell Zarbon he knew of it, because he wanted Zarbon to escape Frieza's grasp on 
his own will. Zarbon almost goes nuts at Vegeta for his lack of information. 
Vegeta doesn't know how to react, however the next events prevent him from 
saying anything further[see 1B]</p>
<p>If you defeated Frieza and the Ginyu Force completely, Zarbon will mourn 
Jeice for a short amount of time, but then the following interrupts him... [see 
1B]</p>
<p><u>1B. Future vs. Present -</u> Whatever you did to defeat Frieza above, you'll be 
interrupted by a voice musing over your 'insignificant' victory. The voice 
insults Frieza, saying that if he couldn't beat you once before, that how could 
he expect to beat you NOW. If Cell is present, he'll identify the voice as that 
of his PRESENT counterpart. Either way, ANOTHER Cell emerges from the exit ahead 
of you, walking over to you. If YOUR Cell is present, the two Cells will banter 
over their morals and goals, Present Cell mentioning that both had come through 
time in some way or form. He also calls Mirai Cell weak for joining you, but 
Mirai replies that once Present does the stuff he did, that the same will happen 
to him. Present denies that will ever happen, and tells you he is known as 
Cell[though you'll know that already], and that he'll crush you. If Cell is not 
there, Vegeta and Zarbon will banter with him, and Present will mention that 
Shaft was apparently right about your trip into the future, and will tell you 
that he intentionally waited to attack you, wanting to challenge you at your 
best. Vegeta calls it an arrogant mistake that will cost Present, but he begs to 
differ. Either way, you'll have to fight him here.</p>
<p>Present Cell is much more difficult to fight than Mirai would've been in the 
future if you fought him. He has a much vaster array of skills, including most 
of Mirai's. He'll take roughly 75,000+ HP of damage just to get him to scoff at 
you. Once this happens, reveals he has a new move to use. He splits himself into 
four different Cells, much similar to a multi-form, except THIS multi-form 
doesn't really weaken him. Now you have a much more considerable threat. Each 
copy of Cell has unique properties, and skills. Most importantly, each one has 
an unique status condition. The most considerable of them being the second Cell 
down, who has REFLECT status on him. This is very agitating, as this prevents 
you from using any all hitting skills on the group of Cells, or any skills 
period on this particular copy, else they be deflected back in your face. This 
Cell is most definitely gonna be priority one to take out. Be warned, many of 
the Cell copies possess Dis[spell] spells which can weaken a character's 
resistance to various elements. For the first stage of this part of the battle, 
you need to slap the second Cell copy with either item effects or physical 
attacks. Now, the Bubsy Claws from the Janepo Illusion Forest can really shine 
in this part of the battle, allowing you to hit all four Cell copies at the same 
time, while still aiming at the one you normally want to hit. Once the second 
Cell copy goes down, you're free to use skills on the other three without fear 
of them being bounced back in your face. You may want to try to get rid of the 
Cell copy that has 100% status, as his high speed makes attacking the copy with 
3/8 Regen a chore with him constantly attacking ahead of schedule. Once that 
copy of Cell goes down, take the one with the Regen status, making sure to use 
strong enough attacks to negate his healing on each turn. Once he falls, there 
should only be the 'Guarded' copy remaining. Beat up on him until he growls at 
you again. Now Cell says he will go to his true potential and wipe you out once 
and for all. The remaining copy[s] reamass into the original Cell, and there's a 
change in the music. Now Cell has around 93,506 HP[note that using the scouter 
or scan moves at this point is useless. You'll get a corrupted scan, which has 
jumbled up stats], and he is immune to almost all elements, and can pretty much 
dodge all physical attacks. Only Noise, Blunt and Typeless initially damage him 
at all. Also, he may additionally be able to increase those resistances by using 
a move called 'Forcefield'. If anyone has 'Dis[spell]' skills, this is a GOOD 
time to use them, else Cell can become literally invincible here. Cell's move 
list has also rapidly expanded too. He will also be able to use Marcus's 
additional skills if he defeated Frieza against you. Once Cell finally dies 
here, you'll win an 'Atma Weapon' for your efforts. If your Cell is present, 
he'll finish the weakened Present Cell off with a Genki Dama. If he's not there, 
Zarbon will instead do the honors. Either way, Present Cell will FINALLY die. 
YAY! :D</p>
<p>If your Cell is present, he finally rejoices, expecting to vanish from the 
threshold of time for defeating his present self. However, he will remember with 
Vegeta's help that his future was not changed by their actions in the present, 
much like his son's travels to the past never altered his own time, thus Cell 
will not vanish. Cell then gets a huge boost to his power, learning roughly 20+ 
skills, and learning his 'Forcefield' spell[the first of 23 in the game :P]. 
Now, you'll be able to move on. If Cell is not here, you'll just proceed on and 
be able to finally reach the exit of this area.</p>
<p><u>1C. Recruiting Frieza[optional] -</u> HOWEVER. One final thing might be required 
to be done. If you defeated Frieza via Jeice, you might remember there's a 
specter of Frieza just floating near the exit. The game won't let you continue 
into Quake's lair until you inspect the specter if this is the case. Upon 
inspecting it, Frieza's spirit talks to you. Zarbon[and Marcus if he defeated 
Frieza the first time] will get almost enraged to the point of exploding, 
especially after Frieza begins to APOLOGIZE to them for his past actions. Not 
believing him at first, Jeice's spirit speaks to them, appearing near you, and 
explaining that Frieza is finally beginning to see what he's done to everyone 
else, and that he wants you to stop Quake for everyone that got hurt because of 
him. Jeice tells you that he was also sent by unknown beings high up and uses a 
strange wing to revive Frieza. Confused and utter baffled to this, he freaks out 
at the sight of you and teleports away. Jeice tells you to find him, and 
convince him he has a third and final chance to change, and that he can help you 
out. Jeice will then be whisked away back to the afterlife. Now, you need to go 
to Nemadonus and swap out everyone for just Don by himself. Now send Don to the 
Janepo Upper Cliffs. North of the crystal here is Frieza, looking out over the 
seas in misery. Talk to him and after a yelling contest, Don finally manages to 
convince Frieza to try one more time. Frieza reluctantly accepts the Polymorph 
Amulet, and teleport to Nemadonus. CONGRATULATIONS if this has happened. You 
just got the second of the three secret characters in the game. If you have both 
him AND Cell by now, give yourself a pat on the back for effort. Frieza can be 
used immediately in a group from this point, and he can be quite helpful too.</p>
<p>After all is said and done, arrange a new group, consisting of AT LEAST 
Tara[also remembering to equip the Atma Weapon on her, as she is the only one 
who can use it], and three other characters, usually Plo, Bonnie, and 
Cell/Frieza/Paula/Rachel. Go back to where you had found Frieza, the Ginyus and 
Cell, and enter the exit to finally leave this area.</p>
<p></p>
<p><u><b>2. Find Quake</b></u></p>
<p><u>2A. The Lava Beast -</u> As you enter the cave, there is a healing star you might 
want to use. Also, the map and position finder are EXTREMELY useful here, as 
this map is one giant twisty-turny cave that goes all over the freakin' place. 
The map should also tell you where Quake himself is at[if you don't see any 
position finders on the map, he's in the top area with island with the orange 
around it on the map, which is way off from where you are currently]. As you 
walk through the cave, you'll start confronting many new enemies, including 
Shamblers, the very same creatures that almost killed Clyde once in the past. 
However you're all much more powerful than in Tara's flashbacks, so you 
shouldn't have too many problems with them, although their thunder-elemental 
attacks might be cause of concern for some people. Another enemy are Jorgs, 
mecha-like creatures with twin chainguns that shoot at you per attack. They take 
a lot more HP to kill, but they only have the Chaingun attack, however they can 
also appear with Shamblers or other mixed groups of enemies. Another unique 
enemy you'll meet the most and in varying numbers per battle are the 
Metamorphias, monsters that will morph into random monsters/sub-boss monsters, 
including Gold Centaurs, Woodman, clones, and other strong or weak monsters. 
They can be only be killed in their natural state by instant death attacks, and 
this will yield 999999 coins and a Guarding Sigil for each pure-formed 
Metamorphia killed.</p>
<p>Anyways, you'll be likely wanting some kind of boss to tear on for having to 
go through this long and twisting cave. Eventually, you'll come to a large pool 
of lava as you're proceeding down the path. When you try to go around it, you'll 
automatically be lead right in front of it, where Tara, Plo and Bonnie will 
comment about 'deja vu' if they're with you. Suddenly the cave shakes and a 
powerful creature of living lava emerges. If you paid attention to the flashback 
about Quake earlier, you'll be able to tell this is Chthon, reborn, and out for 
vengeance on your party! After some words, you'll enter battle with him. As 
stated in the flashback, Chthon is weak to thunder attacks, and absorbs fire 
attacks, and physical attacks do almost nothing in damage to him. Your best 
strategy is to use Disblaze and Disshock on him. The reason for Disblaze is in 
case you decide to use PK Shield Omega on your party, or everyone is wearing 
Shielding Sigils. Chthon uses all fire-elemental attacks, which means deflected 
attacks will HEAL him and declaw your shield's overall effectiveness unless you 
use Disblaze, which will make him only take 0 damage from fire instead of absorb 
it. Once he dies, you'll receive ANOTHER Chthon's Fang[straight from the source 
I might add XD], and you'll be able to continue on.</p>
<p><u>2B. The Alien Robots -</u> As you proceed on, you'll likely get annoyed to 
boredom again with the twists and turns in the cave, and only the random battles 
can usually make you perk up a little. However your life will begin to get 
interesting as once you pass a specific section, you'll hear a strange breathing 
noise, and then the ground will shake back and forth as you hear stomps. If 
you're smart enough, you'll realize this is likely the next boss waiting 
impatiently for you to arrive. After some more walking, you'll come across three 
mecha-looking things, and there is someone inside the center one. Tara must be 
here to talk to him, and once you do so you'll learn he is known as 'The Makron' 
the ruler of a futuristic alien cyborgs called the Strogg, and that he wishes to 
kill Tara to extract her Final Gate spell, as he actually wishes to overthrow 
Quake and rule his armies for himself, and enters battle with you.</p>
<p>Initially, you'll have to face Makron, riding on a Jorg, flanked by two other 
lone Jorgs. Be warned: Makron has a BFG10K and can fire it while still on HIS 
Jorg, and his Jorg is stronger than the others, so he'll take some time to 
defeat. You'll likely remove the other Jorgs before the action begins to heat 
up. After some bashing on his Jorg, you'll hear it begin to break down, however 
you have not won just yet. Makron smartly DISENGAGES and safely lands, now 
facing you mano-e-mano. He is now also HASTED and is faster than you'd expect, 
and now packing Sonic Railgun and Sonic Railgun X which can seriously hurt some 
of your members. He can also use the BFG10K and Plasma Rifle attacks, but loses 
the Chaingun power his Jorg possesses. He might even use a Quad Damage MK II on 
himself to make his attacks stronger. After hacking off about 95,000 damage, 
he'll either die immediately, or you'll hear him die, and you'll win several 
items, including Titanium Jaws[Flaid], a Scouter, and 'Makron's Brain', which 
allows you to use a skill two times per turn[like the Chthon's Fang, except with 
skills, and it is an accessory]. Tara will then comment on how Makron could've 
been a good ally if he hadn't been evil like he had.</p>
<p><u>2C. The Maverick from the Future -</u> Luckily, for the next leg of the journey, 
you do not have to walk nearly as far to get to the next bosses. You're already 
about 2/3s of the way through Quake's cavern by the time you fight Makron. 
You'll also know when you're near the next boss when you enter a snowy area[the 
white area on the mini-map]. You'll notice in the lower left corner of the area 
that another being is waiting for you. However, you also might notice you can 
WALK RIGHT AROUND HIM and ignore him completely. However if you do this, you'll 
miss out on the chance to get the true ending of the game later on. This 
walkthrough section assumes you decide to fight him in battle. You'll also need 
to have at least Tara, Plo and Bonnie in the group, and one other person[I 
usually use Cell if he's available]. He'll reveal himself to be Spark Mandrill, 
who is an old enemy of Tara, Plo and Bonnie from the past. After some 
explanation that Quake reactivated him, you'll enter battle with him, and 
you'll hear more talk and banter between both sides, and Mandrill even saying he 
has his own ways to beat Quake later. After some final banter with Bonnie, 
you'll finally begin the battle.</p>
<p>Be weary here. Mandrill starts out with much more HP than any other boss to 
this point. Mandrill can have anywhere between 156,240 and 546,840 HP depending 
on the game and the difficulty level. He has several electrical based attacks, 
and as hinted, he is weak to ice[despite the fact you're fighting him in an ICY 
part of the lair], but not as much as he did in the last confrontation between 
him and Tara, so Disfrost is useful to use on the first turn. Thunder heals 
him[so if you're planning to shield yourself from his electrical attacks, you 
need to Disshock him first], water does nothing at all, nor does Holy, Fire or 
Dark. He also has several stat boosting moves. Tara can shrug off almost all of 
his moves due to her Thunder immunity, but the other characters may not be so 
lucky, so watch their health in the fight. Another note is when he loses 1/2 or 
more of his HP, he goes into 'Serious' mode, where he is even faster, stronger 
and has more moves, including Sanda, Sandara, and Sandaga[yes, an irregular 
maverick robot using MAGIC, don't be so surprised]. Once you deplete about all 
of his health, you'll see a major scene play out, as Tara asks Mandrill why he 
hates humans so much, and Mandrill basically pours out his life story, including 
the fact he got sent into the past by a freak accident and that Quake took 
advantage of his situation. He also learns from Tara and Cell the plan Sigma put 
him up to wouldn't have worked due to the alternate timeline analogy. Mandrill 
declares himself friend to Tara and tells her about the 'EMBROSIA BOX', a relic 
he believes will be able to contain Quake's physical and spiritual essence for 
good. Tara receives it, and if you defeated Timon using her, she'll bring up 
mention of Timon's declaration of a 'friend' and method to containing Quake. 
Spark is proud of Tara as he declares he will detonate due to extreme damage, 
and tells her and the others to beat Quake for the other Mavericks that never 
understood, and he dies, leaving Tara in a grievous state of affairs. The battle 
will end, and you'll need to heal your group[Mandrill's explosion brings all 
members to 1 HP automatically] before going on further.</p>
<p><u>2D. The Fallen Gladiator -</u> Not too much further through the cave, you'll turn 
a few more times, and come to a bridge where another guardian awaits, and 
despite looking like you can avoid him, you can't unlike with Mandrill. You'll 
have to fight this guardian. Again, Tara must be present for this to occur. 
He'll ask if you came for a 'lesson' and a battle starts, and you'll identify 
this guy as 'Xaero'. He philosophize a little, and start attacking you. In 
essence, you can consider him almost a Makron clone, Haste, Railgun, BFG10K and 
the works. However he holds a major advantage against Makron: he is immune to 
almost ALL elementals, even Typeless. The best method to facing him is to shield 
as many people as possible and let him shoot at them with Sonic Railgun, which 
will deflect and do high damage to him[piercing attacks are his main weakness]. 
After so much fighting, he'll start using Sonic Railgun X, and other stronger 
moves. Also, he might use a Quad on himself as well. When you defeat him, you 
earn a Blessed Morning Star[several characters], and you'll get praise from 
Xaero, learning he is a good natured being stolen from Heaven by Quake to fight 
for him, and that by defeating him, you have freed him to return to where he 
belongs. He gives you a Sonic Railgun WEAPON and wishes you some luck as he 
vanishes back into the heavens. Now, you can cross the bridge behind him, which 
will lead you to the island where Quake is lurking.</p>
<p><u><b>3. Quake's Final Stand</b></u></p>
<p><u>3A. Quake's Honor Guard -</u> Remember that you MUST have at least Tara present 
to enter Quake's island. If she's not there, a crystal will block the way in. 
Upon stepping onto the island, your group will automatically walk up to Quake. 
Each party member makes their own comments, and Quake begins to react, glowing 
with energy, and the battle starts. However, you'll now see that a group of 
guardians protect Quake. Like with Lenako earlier, this group will vary. If 
you're on Very Easy and Easy, you'll just face the Runes of Mars, Earth, Moon 
and Cronos. On Normal, 3 Shamblers additionally flank this group. On Hard, 2 
Shamblers and a Jorg flank Quake and the Runes. On Very Hard, 3 Jorgs flank 
Quake and the Runes, and on EXTREMELY Hard, Chthon and Makron, reincarnated, 
flank the Runes and Quake. For dealing with the extra guardians, use the tactics 
for them mentioned in their respective sections above. The Runes are important 
though, as each can use various attacks of different types, and even more 
importantly, the Rune of Moon can revive other creatures/runes that fall in 
battle, so it might be priority one to take that rune out first, then focus on 
the other enemies. Generally, Antipode attacks work equally well on all Four 
runes, and Holy attacks can hurt two of them, but Antipodes and Typeless attacks 
work at these enemies quickly and effectively. Quake is present, but he will not 
actually do anything, and you cannot truly 'hurt' him at this point either. Just 
ignore him for now. Once the Runes and the other guardians all finally fall and 
Quake is left alone, the background of the battle changes and a new face speaks 
from the sidelines, ending the current battle.</p>
<p><u>3B. Tara vs. Shaft, liberator of Quake -</u> Now you will see a man in a purple 
robe behind Quake, berating Quake for not being able to beat &quot;a bunch of 
teenagers&quot;. Tara realizes this is the Dark Priest Shaft, the man responsible for 
freeing Quake in the first place. Shaft realizes that she is Tara, and they will 
talk a short time before a battle starts. However, if Cell is present, Shaft'll 
recognize him as the future variation and calls him a fool and a different 
battle begins.</p>
<p>If you are fighting him with Cell, remember to take note that Cell will 
attack and use skills twice per turn automatically in this fight. Also, he is 
weak to many different elements and can even be poisoned here. After taking off 
around 200,000 HP he'll attack Cell with 'Omniglare' which will do varying 
damage to him. Cell will counterattack Shaft with a large combo that does over 
20,000 damage, ending that particular battle. He will then curse at you and 
unveil his real powers, now engaging in a another battle.</p>
<p>Now Shaft is a lot more dangerous, and has the ability to actually change the 
terrain of the battle arena, along with the powers he'll use on you. He can also 
use a move called &quot;Dark Emersion&quot;, which heals him, increases his stats by 
double and increases many of his resistances. He can use various level 2, level 
3 and Typeless spells[including BOTH version of Ultima] in addition that make 
him a dangerous enemy. His HP variates depending on the skill level as well. He 
can have about as much as 500,000 at one point. Once you finally do enough 
damage, Quake will growl and finally 'wake up' much like the strange dog in the 
future talked about, and will hit Shaft with an attack that will kill him off 
and remove him from the picture. Talk about having no respect for those who help 
you. :P</p>
<p><u>3C. Tara vs. Quake, the Final Confrontation -</u> Get ready, for from this point, 
you will have to directly fight Quake himself. However you will not be able to 
hurt him much in his initial state. However that soon changes, as he will CHANGE 
FORMS, assuming the personas of Don, Marcus, Mika, Zarbon, Tara, Joleena, Ness, 
Paula, Jeff, Poo, Cell, Vegeta, and even Frieza. This is when you'll be able to 
damage Quake. It's important to be aware of what your own characters are strong 
and weak to at base[without armor, weapons or stat boosts like Nekosa, Magi Lv. 
1, etc], for their attributes will match up with the forms Quake assumes. For 
example, at base Don is weak to Missile elemental attacks, so Quake will take 
extreme damage from Missile attacks when he is in Don's form, etc. Quake will be 
able to use those people's strongest attacks. Also, if you beat Frieza with 
Marcus and got Nekosa, Quake can use his Master Weapons while in Marcus's form. 
Also, if he's in his normal form, he runs a small risk of using Ultima on you on 
each turn, so keep at least 1 or 2 people in 'Defend' mode while he's in normal 
state just in case.</p>
<p>Quake's HP depends on the difficulty level and can be as high as 1,500,000 HP 
on EXTREMELY Hard, or as low as 375,000 HP on Very Easy. As you whack off 
Quake's health, he'll growl at you, calling you cockroaches and other insults. 
At one point Tara will start bantering back with him. Later, she'll 
automatically attempt a final gate on Quake, but it will fail[if you have the 
Embrosia Box, she'll purposely let it fail to trick Quake]. As this occurs, Cell 
and Zarbon, if present in the battle, will start trying to combine their own 
efforts into a super attack, which once done can wrack upwards of 53,500 damage 
at best if they're both present [max of 22,500 for Cell, and a max of 31,000 for 
Zarbon]. However this will fail to defeat Quake, and the situation will seem 
hopeless. After a long period of no banter, you'll eventually see Quake get 
attacked by a strange particle beam that shakes the screen and weakens him. 
After doing a little bit more damage, if you have the Embrosia Box, you can 
stand by and just heal until Quake reverts to his original form, and then Quake 
will taunt Tara about destroying her first so she won't see her friends killed 
in front of her eyes, but she confidently reveals the Embrosia Box, even when 
Quake drains them to the last of them strength, and the box will suck him up 
into it, but not before he gives a warning that human curiosity will free him 
someday. However, Quake will seldom ever revert to his original form at this 
point, so it might be necessary to keep attacking him. Eventually, after you do 
in so much damage, he'll be too weakened to hold a different form and will 
revert back to normal automatically, where the same scenario with the Embrosia 
Box happens. If you do not have the Embrosia Box at this point, Tara will summon 
a deeper level Final Gate which slowly succeeds in sucking Quake back into it. 
However rest assured you aren't gonna get the true ending of the game during 
this particular play-through if it comes to having to use Final Gate to finish 
him.</p>
<p>Finally, the battle will end, and a healing star appears where Quake was 
floating. Walk onto it to gain a bonus 25-100 Max HP boost to all the currently 
found characters in the game, and full healing. Also, you will be teleported 
back to the healing star at the beginning of the lair, as the screen fades out 
into an intermission screen. Read all the hubba-jubba and prepare to enter 
CHAPTER 2 of DMA:UE. Congratulations if you've made it this far, you're doing 
good. :)</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Part 6: The Jikuba Redux</font></b></p>
<p><u><b>1. Raiden's Dire News!</b></u></p>
<p><u>1A. The God of Thunder and Fire -</u> Once the transition to Chapter 2 finishes 
up, you'll be in control of Don again in the character selection room on 
Nemadonus, and he'll be talking to the rest of the assembled team. At the 
moment, he is more than happy the group was able to defeat Quake with no 
casualties. After some more talking, he'll walk outside automatically, where you 
can now control him. Your objectives will flash. Reading the Mandatory 
objectives will tell you the Strange Dog you met in the alternate future Cell 
came from has arrived on Nemadonus, and it's time to find out why he intended to 
see you again if you defeated Quake. Walk to him and talk to him to learn of how 
proud he is of you. If Tara sealed Quake in the Embrosia Box, he'll also 
congratulate you on finding it, saying he was hoping to have found it before he 
faced you in the past, but Don is fine with the help he had already received. 
The dog will ask Don to gather his friends all out to see you, which he will do 
automatically. Now the Dog will answer Flaid's original question, which is that 
he is not like him or Bonnie, and that he is in fact not in his real form. He 
promptly transforms back to normal, surprising both Rachel and Poo, who seem to 
recognize him. Poo calls him Raiden, God of Thunder and the protector of Earth. 
Raiden confirms Poo to be right, but adds he has not become the God of Fire in 
addition, but declines to explain why at the moment, claiming a dire situation 
dawning on them. After clearing up with Tara the threat has nothing to do with 
the recently defeated-Quake, he begins asking Zarbon, Flaid, Marcus, Plo, 
Bonnie, Don and Mika/Jean questions concerning Woodman, Lenako, Shadowman and 
all the other happens involving the Jikuba, revealing all of it is connected, 
and that the robot masters are actually duplicate recreations of their original 
selves on Earth, fortified with greater powers. Raiden reveals 5 more robot 
masters still roam Cronos, he says one is hiding somewhere inside the Janepo 
Cliffs, away from Zarbon[and Mirai Cell]'s hiding place. Another is stated to be 
somewhere near Janepo Ninja Castle, but in an area outside the castle you have 
not yet been to. Another is hiding deeper within the Janepo Illusion Forest, 
beyond the north clearing where Woodman was encountered. The fourth is far out 
overseas on a mass of land you have not yet gone to, and the final master is 
always moving around over Cronos, never in one place. Raiden firmly believes 
Lenako made that Robot Master an Airship to allow the master to attack and 
harass various locations on Cronos without fear of your retaliation. He says the 
Robot Masters on Janepo Island should be taken down first before the other ones. 
He will teleport inside the house on Nemadonus, where you can periodically go to 
him for tips on each situation, or gain information of the robot master you just 
destroyed if any]. He will also advise you to pick your first target wisely, as 
the Jikuba are not fully aware of Quake's defeat, but will raise their defenses 
in their remaining bases once you defeat one of the next three Robot Masters. 
This walkthrough will go through each robot master's domain in order of my 
assumed difficulty, from easiest to hardest, noting changes that may occur due 
to certain masters being alive or destroyed prior to entry in their domains.</p>
<p><u><b>2. The Assault</b></u></p>
<p><u>2A. Junk as a Powerful Weapon (easy)-</u> Going to the master in the Janepo 
Cliffs is the easiest choice to make, even if you've already defeated the other 
masters already. The only hard part of getting to him aside from his security is 
that the area of the cliffs your in is like a small maze. You will fight new 
groups of monsters as well. Be careful of a group of Asbestos Robos, as they can 
mess up a group of characters if given the chance or if they get a back/pincer 
attack on you. Near the end of the intended path, you'll see a robot blocking 
your way. If you've already defeated another Robot Master prior to this, there 
will be FIVE of these robots. Talk to them, and you'll enter a battle with 
one/five Fusion Pump[s]. Recall the strategy of them when you had to get the 
3-Star Dragonball earlier: Noise, Blunt, Typeless and Blade attacks work best. 
However if five pumps are there, it can get very annoying with them constantly 
shooting rockets at you. An odd thing that can happen is that you can inflict 
&quot;Bleeding&quot; on the pumps by using swords on them, despite the fact they are 
robots. When they go down, you can proceed to the next room, where the Robot 
master himself awaits. Depending on if or if not you've destroyed other masters, 
he will banter various things at you, introducing himself as Junkman, and a 
battle starts.</p>
<p>Junkman's HP is dependant on skill level. He will not be simple, having 
142,926 to 285,852 [Very Easy to EXTREMELY Hard]. His attacks consist of Body 
Blow, Kienzan Volley, and his signature Junk Shield, which he summons around you 
to smash you with debris. When he falls below 50%, he'll gain Buffed status and 
start attacking you more viciously. When drained to the last 10% or less of his 
power, he defiantly accepts his fate, and self-destructs in your face. However 
when you beat him, Marcus will gain Junk Shield[unless he defeated Frieza 
earlier in Chapter 1 and already has it].</p>

<p><u><b>Xa. Marcus's Journey (Extended Mode - Marcus)</b></u></p>
<p><u><b>Xb. Flaid's Beginnings (Extended Mode - Flaid)</b></u></p>
<p>This chapter is activated by walking up to Flaid at either the Janepo 
Waterfalls or in the Cave outside Janepo Ninja Castle[on EXTREMELY Hard skill 
only]. The screen will fade out and will inform you of the change to an Extended 
Mode Chapter. You will now find yourself looking over an island, and the screen 
pans up until you find a small house in the middle of the island. Inside, you 
will see Flaid, but you will also see an old man in green walk over to the 
middle of the room and call him over. You'll learn his name is 'Gadmir', and 
through the dialogue that occurs, that he is apparently Flaid's original 
master. He will leave, telling Flaid he is heading east overseas, asking Flaid 
to guard the island for him, and leaves. You will now be able to control Flaid, 
and lead him outside.</p>
<p>Now, do as Gadmir said, and make Flaid patrol and guard the island. 
Preferably walk along the sandy shoreline, until you reach the northeastern part 
of the island. Flaid will automatically move up towards the north part of the 
beach, sensing something wrong and out of place. Suddenly, three strange 
creatures phase in in front of Flaid, and he isn't even able to get out a word 
before a battle starts. Now, you'll notice what MIGHT appear to be familiar 
looking creatures, floating and in robes. These are actually DARK BISHOPS from 
the original Hexen Wars, except they are no longer as weak as over 1000 years 
ago. Flaid can barely get in a word in edgewise before they quickly attack him, 
knocking him unconscious before he can even make a single move[in other words, 
this is an unwinnable battle]. Now Flaid will be lying in the sand and 
unconscious, when a strange bat-like creature appears behind the three robed 
figures. This creature is revealed to be their leader, and you learn they're all 
here looking for Gadmir, and that Flaid was just an obstruction. However, Gadmir 
is actually not too far from Flaid when the attacked occurred, and he has 
returned. After seeing his best friend lying in the sand knocked for a loop, he 
scoots Flaid away and behind him, and gets enraged at the leader and his 
minions, entering another battle.</p>
<p>Again, you have no control over what happens in this battle, so just sit back 
and watch. Gadmir grills the leader about his intentions, and the leader 
introduces himself as &quot;Lord Charon&quot;. The fight kicks up, and Gadmir is 
considerably stronger than Flaid is at the time, and will exterminate the three 
minions, and do some considerable damage to Charon himself. However, despite 
Gadmir's efforts, Charon tricked him into thinking he was weaker than he really 
was. He unleashes the almighty magic of Ultimara[yes, a LEVEL TWO Ultima] on 
Gadmir, more than easily KOing him, and in fact mortally damaging him, and the 
battle ends.</p>
<p>Charon claims Gadmir is already dead, and teleports off, content he has 
succeeded. Gadmir is dying slowly from his fatal battle, but he still has enough 
strength to bring Flaid back to his feet, and pleading him to go east, as he had 
planned on doing himself, to find Don Miguel, and to become his guardian and 
protector. He also tells Flaid he himself must grow stronger, and defeat Charon. 
Flaid doubts his abilities and isn't just ready to let his master die, but 
Gadmir tells him that Flaid has the potential to save not only the universe, but 
the 'Omniverse' as well. Not aware of the meaning of the last comment, Flaid 
still accepts his newly found fate, and says a final goodbye as his master dies. 
He heads to the ship Gadmir had been using, and boards it, heading east, until 
the water flares up and damages his ship. Luckily, he is able to make it past 
the Janepo Lower Cliffs, and even to the Waterfalls, his ship sinking just as he 
reaches landfall south of the waterfalls. Flaid walks around, setting himself 
down at the fence, and begins to await Don's arrival, and the scene fades out, 
ending the chapter... (on EXTREMELY Hard mode he'll walk all the way to outside 
the cave that leads to the castle, and then the screen fades out)</p>
