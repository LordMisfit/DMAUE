'Piano Girl'[aka Sarah Josephine Nagar]: By far one of the oddest helper 
characters in the game, the Piano Girl is first seen after you clear the castle 
and defeat Lenako. She will have moved into the lower Janepo Cliffs, just below 
where the game starts. She gives Don the Quietus, and she also hints to you that 
Zarbon is in the Inner Janepo Cliffs, and later Zarbon takes her to Nemadonus, 
since he views her to be possibly a mystic being in the form of a little girl. 
She also hints about being able to get Cell and Frieza as secret characters, and 
tells you the Mr. Saturns also exist on Cronos and are creators of that planet's 
Dragonballs. She will likely have even more roles to fill as Don and the others 
fight on and adventure on...</p>
