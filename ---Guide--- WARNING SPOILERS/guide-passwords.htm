<p><b>Cheater's Mode:</b> To get the password for the cheat mode, you must get the TRUE 
ending[the ending involving Minion and then the Misfits], AND you must revive 
Gadmir and Tanrasus with the Ankh of Life, and you must also spare Shadowman's 
life near the end of the game in addition. <i><u><b>(4846701-4841445-4527874)<br>
</b></u></i><b>Warp to Erebus:</b> Beat Erebus within 30 turns, and you'll get an additional 
password that will take you straight to the final section of the game. You'll be 
able to quickly face Erebus again, just for the heck of it, with all 23 
characters, and their stats vastly increased, AND with the best equipment and 
items. XD <i><u><b>(3277585-4566557-4841325)<br>
</b></u></i><b>Ending Library:</b> To get this code, you must accomplish all of the requirements 
for Cheater's Mode, and you must in addition learn all 23 of the playable 
characters' &quot;Forcefield&quot; spells. The ending library is basically a debug mode 
that allows you to view a majority of the endings, including the TRUE ending of 
the game. You can set variations to the endings, such as who killed Erebus, if 
Tanrasus is revived, if Gadmir is revived, if Shadowman was spared or not, if 
Sandra fought Korax after his initial resurrection, if Tara let Minion have 
Quake back or not, etc. There is also one final ending, one that is not 
attainable by normal means, and is not linked directly with DMA:UE itself, but 
still involves the characters, as well as the Misfits characters[basically, it's 
a scene of Flaid realizing of what Gadmir truly meant when he said Flaid would 
save the 'Omniverse', if you saw his extended mode part]. <i><u><b>(4554030-4846701-3277585)</b></u></i></p>
