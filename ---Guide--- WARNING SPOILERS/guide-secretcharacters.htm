<title>Secret Characters in DMA:UE</title>

<p><font size="6">---- II. Secret Characters ----</font></p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u><i> There are three 'secret characters' in DMA:UE. They're 
not secret as much in a traditional RPG sense, but more of in a sense that you 
have to know what you're doing to attain them. The common, run-of-the-mill first 
time player will likely miss out on the second of the characters, and might be 
hinted enough to gain the last one, and might just go through the trouble of 
listening to hints for getting the first. However unlike the majority of games 
with characters like these, having them DOES vastly change parts of the plot, 
and in fact, you MUST get all three secret characters in the same playthrough to 
have a chance at the TRUE ending of the game, also you must get all three in the 
same game to get the Confirmation Code for Alternate Route Mode. In addition to 
that, for each secret character you find, your

increases by 0.2 seconds 
from what it normally would be.</i></p>

Cell[DNA Fighter]: <br>
Full Name:</b> (Mirai no) Cell Gero<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;Evil is extremely overrated. Take it from someone who actually 
accomplished what he intended. Without competition or enemies, life is useless.&quot;</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> Mirai No Perfect Cell, as much of a villain as he starts out as 
in his story to you, will actually become a very valuable ally to you, and vital 
to helping counter the things in your timeline that had already happened in his 
own. To find him, take Vegeta to the tent located just outside of the Janepo 
Waterfalls and he will examine a special crystal and blow it away revealing a 
stairway, leading to a time machine that will take you 10 years into the future, 
only to find Cronos in devastation, Robot Guardians all over the place, and no 
sight of your future selves anywhere. With Mika AND Vegeta in the party, go over 
to the caves just outside of Mika's old castle. One of the Ninjas will be there, 
and she will tell you what happened: Cell had come and killed most of the heroes 
of Cronos and Earth of the future before they had gotten strong enough to really 
face with any of Quake's minions, but that after Cell had killed Don personally 
that he had fled into the Inner Janepo Cliffs, and never returned from there. 
Now take Zarbon AND Vegeta to the cliffs, and go to where you found Zarbon 
before Frieza arrived in his throne room. Cell will be there, awaiting you[if 
you don't have both Zarbon and Vegeta in the group, he'll beg you to kill him, 
and if you kill him, you won't be able to get him to join you]. He will tell his 
story to you, about how he was revived after Zarbon and Don's group killed 
Frieza with the Chou Genki Dama, and was sent by the very man who released Quake 
from the Dead Zone, the Dark Priest, Shaft, to destroy Quake's enemies', but 
after Cell had been successful, he foresaw Shaft's true plan, which he has not 
yet mentioned, and killed Shaft in mortal combat. Shaft stole some of his 
strongest powers, but Cell finished him off via Buu-style absorbsion, and 
technically 'saved' what remained of Earth and Cronos, even though both had 
fallen into ruin. Zarbon gives him a Polymorph Amulet, and Cell agrees to assist 
them, having found his good side after killing Shaft. <br>
<i><b>[One very important note concerning Cell: While he has roughly 4/5s of all 
the techniques in the game, some of the best ones he lacks, AND he CANNOT level 
up, having only one level [but with 9850+ HP, so he is the second highest in HP 
next to Zarbon], so he does not count towards removing the barrier to Quake's 
lair.]<br>

<b>Total Ailment Resistance Points:</b> 96/110</p>
<p><b>Special Command:</b> Copy<br>
Copy allows Cell to attempt to damage the enemy and gain one of their 
techniques permanently for his own use. It will pick an enemy at random that is 
still alive, and do roughly 66% to 133% of normal damage to Cell's target. There 
is at least a 66% chance Cell will learn one random skill from the enemy in 
question. However, stronger powers tend to be harder to get. Also, when 
extracting a skill from the monster, it will cost Cell TP equal to the amount 
normally needed for a casting of the skill he's copying. If he lacks sufficient 
TP, he will lose 48 HP for each TP he lacks when getting the move. There is a 
chance that Cell can completely miss with this too, leaving him open to 
attack.</p>
<p><b>Desperation Move:</b> Koru<br>
Koru is basically Cell's new type of absorption[the same kind he tells you he 
used to kill Mirai no Shaft]. It will target the enemy and will normally absorb 
them whole. Even some bosses aren't fully immune to this. When he successfully 
absorbs a character, he gains a boost to HP, TP, Attack, Defense, Mind, and 
Speed dependant on the enemy's stats. Also, he may gain a couple new abilities 
as well.</p>

<b>Frieza[Icer Royal]: </b><br>
<b>Full Name:</b> Frieza Samuke Gentou<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;Don't ever try to tell me such a thing as a &quot;pure heart&quot; 
exists! If one did, not even the evil of their peers would affect them in any 
way.&quot;</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> As much of a villain he was before this game, and IS DURING the 
game, Frieza CAN be attained as a secret character, but you will not be able to 
do so until after deactivating the barrier blocking Quake's lair[BTW, to do 
that, Don, Marcus, Flaid, Mika, Jean, Helen, Zarbon, Tara, Plo, Bonnie, Marcus 
M., Vegeta, Joleena M., Rachel, Clyde, Ness, Paula, Jeff and Poo must ALL be at 
level 99, AND you have to defeat the 'Strange Dog' on the cliffs overlooking 
Mika's old castle near where the Ninja in the future tells you about Cell]. When 
you make your way to the CORRECT entrance to Quake's lair, you will encounter 
Frieza and the Ginyu Force, awaiting you. If you lack Zarbon and Vegeta here[and 
Cell if you found him], Frieza will tell you that he will not waste his time 
fighting 'distractions' like you, and request you to bring Zarbon and Vegeta to 
him[and Cell if you found him]. If the required characters are present[and any 
other fourth character], Frieza and the Ginyus will exchange banter with Zarbon 
and Vegeta, the most notable of them being Jeice's dialogue, asking Zarbon why 
he had betrayed the rest of them. Pay attention to this, as it is key to getting 
Frieza later. You will now fight a VERY hard battle with all six of them. Be 
warned, Frieza CAN go to 100% in this fight as well when you do so much damage, 
and be even MORE warned: Jeice can use ULTIMA as well against you, being one of 
the few monsters who can use it[aside from Timon]. To get Frieza, kill Ginyu, 
Baata, Rikoom, Gurudo, and leave Jeice alive, and wear 100% level Frieza to 
within 25% of his max HP. Jeice will bring back up the subject about Zarbon's 
betrayal to you. Zarbon and him talk a little, Frieza adding in his own banter 
at Zarbon to the mix. Zarbon tells Jeice that Frieza had Vegeta unknowingly blow 
up their world, Kerda-sei, but claiming the core of the planet had destabilized 
and caused the solar winds to fry it to a crisp and explode in a ball of fire. 
Frieza beats up Zarbon a little, claiming his words to be lies. Jeice begins to 
understand, noting of his PL difference to Frieza's own in their first lives, 
and how Frieza had simply used everyone in his army as a tool because he was too 
lazy to do anything himself. Frieza congratulates Jeice's judgment, and admits 
to it, before giving Jeice a mortal injury. Jeice however has one final surprise 
for Frieza, a level-2 Ultima called ULTIMARA, and uses it to return a mortal 
wound back to Frieza, ending the fight. In the following events, Jeice throws 
himself in the way of a final barrage of energy from Frieza meant to kill your 
group, and dies, and then Frieza becomes a ghost and dies. You will then fight 
Present Day Cell. Beat him, and 'talk' to Frieza's ghost. He will ask you to 
avenge everyone he's hurt, and defeat Quake. Jeice's ghost comes back and says 
that Frieza finally begins to understand the pain he's caused, and revives 
Frieza with a special Wing. Frieza, instead of attacking you while in your 
weakened state, teleports off in urgency to stay away from you. After this, go 
back to the Upper Janepo cliffs with Don, BY HIMSELF, and talk to Frieza. He and 
Don will argue for a while, ending with Frieza giving it one final shot and 
accepting the offer to help you, and he becomes playable now. As a character, 
Frieza is VERY useful, and CAN go to 100% power, and with even more 
effectiveness when he is playable than when he was as a boss. He can also now 
use Furea, Megafurea, Gigafurea, and even Big Guard to benefit your group.<br>
