<p>Erebus the Agent of Chaos, is the final officially-'killable' boss of DMA:UE, 
and he is by far the most deadly. Unlike most present RPGs, who have an optional 
boss much much stronger than the final boss, Erebus follows the older tradition 
that 'the final boss should be by far the hardest'. And he does NOT disappoint. 
With millions of HP[even on Very Easy], basically limitless TP, and his unique 
variation of attacks, he can give even veteran players a headache on Very Easy 
mode, much less be a nightmare on EXTREMELY Hard. Another unique thing about him 
is that all of his attacks are in foreign languages[below]. His stats below are 
as given:</p>
<p><b><u>HP Totals:<br>

<p><u><b>Attacks:</b></u><br>
<b>Abbau des Besitzes[German]:</b> Targets an enemy, and will do minor to 
moderate-high damage, attempting to remove one of the target's pieces of 
equipment. Can be specifically annoying when Erebus uses this and removes a 
Shielding or Frieza Sigil, as it also negates the effects once given by those 
items. This CANNOT be used on some equipment, and legendary weapons. If he 
attempts to remove a QUIETUS, it will backfire and slam him for severe 
damage[12400-23000 HP]. The attack has a 45% hit rate on average. This does not 
completely remove equipment from the item list, it just unequips it from the 
target. The items can still be used with the item command, but they cannot be 
reequipped.<br>
<b>L'articolo Distrugge[French]:</b> Targets the whole party, looking similar to 
Abbau Des Besitzes, except there is no damage done, however almost always will 
it end up destroying between 1-20 of one type of consumable curative, 
restorative, or supportive items. Pocket Shelters will not be affected due to 
their unusefulness in battles.<br>
<b>Brink Van Dood[Dutch]:</b> Think of Weak in FF4. It basically targets either one 
or all characters and drops their HP to 1 digit[between 1-9]. Very nasty if he 
does it, and manages another move on an un-shielded party before one of them can 
heal.<br>
<b>Scion des flammes[German]:</b> His variation on the fire element. It works much 
like Merton/Meltdown in FF6, hitting both your group AND Erebus with the attack. 
Due to it's chaotic nature, despite his base immunity to fire, he is NOT spared 
of damage, and will take 150-200% of the damage that your most affected 
character takes.<br>
<b>Shockwave der Kälte[German]:</b> Mainly a Ice version of Scion des Flames. Erebus 
also takes damage equal to 150-200% of the most damaged party member.<br>
<b>Blut der Tinte[Dutch]:</b> Targets a character and attempts to steal between 
90-100% of their current HP/TP and drain it into himself. Some characters are 
more resistant to it than others.<br>
<b>Fusione Di Caos[Italian]:</b> Erebus will target one character, who is to be the 
'receiver', and then he targets a second character to be the 'giver'. He then 
forces the 'giver' character's HP/TP to transfer into the 'receiver', healing 
the receiver, but KOing the 'giver' 9 out of ten times, and leaving them with 0 
HP/TP. The catch to it is that each successful use will weaken him against Scion 
des flammes and Shockwave der Kälte further than normal.<br>
<b>Gerador Do Afterimag[Portuguese]:</b> Erebus will generate several afterimages of 
himself, giving him the Image status.</p>
