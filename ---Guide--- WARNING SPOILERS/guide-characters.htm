any stat raising items/equipment you may give them during the game, and are their base 
stats at this point, so they can have more than this[or less(see 4th Brown Chest

Don Miguel[Adventurer]:<br>
Full Name:</b> Don Tyler Miguel<br>
<b>Quote:</b> <i>&quot;What's the point of an adventure or saving something if you 
can't lighten up things a little?&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Our game's main hero. As of the current point in the game, not a 
terribly huge amount of information is known on Don's past, but it appears that 
he is on the verge of adulthood and has personally embarked on his own journey 
to make a name for himself somewhere. He's decided to try treasure hunting for a 
first job when he meets Marcus[the cat] for the first time at the Upper Janepo 
Cliffs[the beginning of the game]. As an actual fighter, Don is more of a 
jack-of-all-trades, being able to use Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, and even some 
Master Weapons, like Metal Blade and Shadow Blade. Later on in the game he can 
use Genki Damas and other special abilities. However he tends to lack in his 
healing powers, and is not the fastest of the characters. He's more of a equally 
balanced character in most areas. <br>
<b>Personality:</b> Don is NOT like most of the recent main RPG heroes, who tend to 
either be extremely angsty, or whiny brats about the world. Don seeks not 
personal gain, but the love and trust of those around him. He also looks UP upon 
a difficult task or job, and has in fact recently embarked out on his own to 
prove he can take care of himself without his parents. He is also still fond of 
having fun even in the midst of a serious situation, and has a childhood love 
for treasure hunting. This allows him to get along extremely well with Marcus 
when they meet, for one. He is a great young man to his friends, and a usually 
respected, albiet scorned enemy among the villains of the game. He may not be 
the most historically informed of his inner circle of friends[as Helen easily 
takes the crown there], but he tries to adapt to historical situations when 
trialed.<b><br>

<b>Marcus[Magic Cat]:</b><br>
<b>Full Name:</b> Marcus Darius Reemer<br>
<b>Quote:</b> <i>&quot;I might be one of the little guys, but sometimes the little 
guys are the big hitters.&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Like Don, Marcus's origin is little known. What we do know at 
this point is that he is sent to find Don, as well as find a special treasure in 
Mika's Ninja Castle, which his other 'friends' say is of utmost importance to 
find. Marcus is in all actuality, a talking cat with good speed, low HP and 
defense, but good attack, and he is more of a &quot;Unique&quot; technique user. He can 
learn all the game's Master Weapon attacks, all the game's Maverick Weapon 
Attacks, most Ki-Based Attacks, and other various powers, and even some healing 
abilities, but he lacks most elemental magic[except master/maverick weapons with 
elemental properties], if he has any at all. He is also the first character that 
can use Scan without a Scouter. As a fighter, he is speedy, and handy in most 
aspects, but he tends to go down at times in long boss fights. One more note is 
that Marcus will not gain TP nearly as fast as the other characters at first, 
and most of your TP Apples will likely be given to him in the early parts of the 
game[he has NO TP at all at levels 1-3 without TP Apples.]. One final note is 
that with the right actions, Marcus can be permanently powered up to a much more 
effective character by attaining his 'Nekosa' levels. These levels allow him to 
gain a new array of skills, and each level increases his elemental/ailment 
resistances by 1 level, meaning he is nigh-invulnerable if he hits Nekosa Lv. 2.<br>

<b>Pros:</b> Capable of using ANY Robot Master/Maverick Weapons in the game, can 
Scan enemies without a scouter, faster than Flaid and Don. Attack is higher than 
Flaid's, completely immune to stat-lowering moves, Nekosa levels greatly 
strengthen his repertoire of skills along with his ailment and elemental 
resistances, if you can get them<br>

TP-raising items. Does not like water. :P</p>

<b>Flaid[Magic Puppy]: <br>
Full Name:</b> Flaid Hathor Ares<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;Do we all truly believe we know ourselves as a union, or are 
we just crazy and delusional?&quot;</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> Flaid is the TRUE definition of &quot;Man's Best Friend&quot;. Flaid's 
story is also barely known to us. What we know on him is that he was sent to Don 
by an unknown being to be his guardian, and that he knows nothing of his 
parents. Flaid is a big dog[or puppy], but his age of 2 months deceives his big 
size, and no one at first would see him as just a puppy. However, due to his big 
size, Flaid has by far the highest overall HP of all the Cronos-born characters 
in the game, and he also has the highest TP as well out of them. Flaid's defense 
is also high, but his attack and speed is a countercedant to Marcus', and are 
lower than some of the other characters. Flaid however truly shines through his 
HUGE arsenal of magic that he can oddly use, which adds more to his mystery: how 
did he get these powers, and why? All things said, Flaid is one of your most 
useful characters in most of the game, so use him well. One final note is that 
Flaid is the ONLY NON-secret character who can use Ultima in this game through 
natural training. Anyone else who learns it must learn it some other way.<br>

<b>Mika[Ninja Royal]: <br>
Full Name:</b> Mika Iris Senades<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;Don't bow, I hate it when people treat me as their superior. 
I'm as human as most of you are.&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Known as the &quot;Nightblade Princess&quot; to her Ninja-Knight subjects, 
Mika is the first girl to join you in the game, and one of the most useful 
characters in the game as well due to her having one of the highest speed levels 
in the game. Being a Ninja, Mika can learn attacks like Metal Blade, Shadow 
Blade, and can wield the elements of Wind, and later on, Fire, Ice and Holy. Her 
HP is actually quite high in the game, being within a good vicinity of Don's own 
HP, although not more, but she definitely can withstand more punishment than 
Marcus can most of the time, and she can hit hard and fast. Her defense lacks to 
an extent though, and her attack is not perfect, but it can vary depending on 
her weapon. She is also one of the only characters[other than Jean] who can use 
Afterimage on herself to make herself untouchable by physical attacks. As an 
overall character she is almost as useful as Flaid is in most of the game.<br>

Total Ailment Resistance Points: 79/110</p>
<p><b>Special Command:</b> Aim/Pillage<br>
Aim is basically similar to the Throw command of the Final Fantasy series. 
The difference with Mika is that she will choose a random consumable item of any 
type of throw it at the enemy. She may also throw more than one thing per use 
depending on her mood. Also, she CAN randomly choose to throw one of your 
unequipped weapons, armors or accessories at the enemies. However, she can only 
throw common and sellable equipment at enemies. She will NOT throw an unequipped 
Quietus at an enemy, or throw a Helmet of Baratus at the foe. However, if the 
weapon she throws happens to be a set of Shurikens, she does in access of 21,000+ 
damage to the target. If she throws Ninja Stars with it, she'll do over 46,000+ 
damage to the target. If she uses the Tack Stars, she'll do around 87,500+ 
damage to a single target. If she throws a Claw-type weapon at the enemy, she 
can run a chance of killing the victim of the attack instantly[even 
weak-moderate level bosses], if she throws a sword at enemies, she may cut their 
remaining HP after the initial damage by a specific fraction depending on the 
sword she throws. <br>
Also, if equipped with the right accessory, the command becomes Pillage, 
which is just like Aim, except in addition, she'll use the last thrown item to 
attempt to retrieve an item off of the target foe that you cannot normally win. 
In other words, Pillage is a combo of Steal/Capture and Throw.</p>
<p><b>Desperation Move:</b> Backstabbing Requerium<br>
Mika will afterimage at one foe[or two if she has 1-digit HP, and there are 
two foes in the battle alive], and appear behind them with immense speed, then 
she stabs them in the back with her swords/stars. She will always do within 
7/10s to full damage to her enemy. Also, in addition, she will steal a whole 
mess of items off the enemy, and also gain some stat gains in small, but 
increasingly greater jumps the more she successfully pulls it off. She can also 
heal a small part of her health with the move.</p>

Helen[Magic Genius]:<br>
Full Name:</b> Helen Lucia Forscythe<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;To strive for knowledge means you must prepare for the worst, 
or even far beyond what you might be able to take.&quot;</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> Helen is in actuality, the childhood best friend of Don, and 
they keep in touch a lot during the game. At first she won't actually join you, 
but she does offer you her position finder to use with the map Marcus gives at the 
beginning of the game. Later on though, Helen does join you, and as a fighter, 
she isn't the strongest physically, or the fastest, but has one of the highest 
Willpower and Defense levels in the game. She can also use a WIDE variety of 
spells, and is the first to learn &quot;Rebirth&quot;, which can mass heal/resurrect her 
whole group of allies[not to mention restore everyone's TP completely as well 
:P]. She can wield Antipode attacks, can use Bottle Rockets, wields special 
gun-based skills like Chaingun, BFG9K, BFG10K, etc, and also uses the same main 
magic elements as Don. She is also one of the two characters in the game that 
can use the Ethereal Crossbows from Parthoris, the only other being Rachel. 
Helen also has some important knowledge about Cronos' past involvement with the 
Serpent Rider Korax over 1000 years ago, and what she knows may make a 
life-saving difference much later.<br>

<b>Jean[Ninjitsu Kid]: </b><br>
<b>Full Name:</b> Jean Francis Blake<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;Fate and Destiny are not as intertwined as you might believe. 
Prophecy can only foresee so much.&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Jean is the highest of Mika's students, and also her best friend 
from the castle. Mika has been training Jean to be an unique form of Ninja who 
could wield most Cronoian magic along with the skills of the Ninja-Knight 
clans. However, when Lenako threatens the Ninja kingdom, Jean sacrifices his 
freedom to allow Mika to escape, and eventually get Don, Marcus and Flaid's help 
later. He is turned into a 'copy' of the Robot Master Metalman by Lenako's 
magic, but Mika frees him with her first Antipode attack, reverting Jean back to 
his original form. However the Metalman battle, and further wounds inflicted 
from Lenako's 'copy' of Shadowman make him unable to fight until Frieza is 
killed the first time and Tara arrives on Cronos. As a fighter, Jean is almost as 
fast as Mika, but has more HP, more attack, but a bit less defense and 
willpower. However, as mentioned above, Jean can also learn how to use 
Afterimage, making him impossible to be hit with physical attacks. His fire, 
ice, water and electrical magic are also high on the food chain. He can also use 
Rasp to damage enemy TP levels, or even later, Ultimate Rasp, which totally 
kills an enemy's TP reserve, so he can be a very useful ally in some places, but 
sometimes a more mediocre one in others.<br>
<b><i>[Side Note: In Alternate Route mode, it is possible to make Jean take Mika's 
place during the first 3 parts of the game, and their roles flip. Jean will be 
able to gain some specific powers much earlier than he normal can in this, and 
even some moves he couldn't get at all in the normal game]<br>

For the most part, Jean's 'DoomCoin' special is much similar to GP Toss in 
the Final Fantasy games. However in addition, he may also additionally throw one 
item of a random, consumable type at the enemy. The damage is somewhat random, 
however you have a choice to input how many of your coins you want Jean to throw 
at the foe, so this is a little more controllable than the common GP Toss 
ability.</p>

Zarbon[Kerda Royal]: <br>
Full Name:</b> Zarbon Calmidrian Hensa<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;To walk both sides of the light and dark is to gain a true 
understanding of yourself.&quot;</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> Zarbon has actually lived two lives now, including this one. 
However he was nearly pure evil in his first, being the most loyal servant to 
the intergalactic tyrant Frieza. The kicker of it all was that Frieza had another 
of his minions, Vegeta, destroy Zarbon and his ally Jeice's planet of Kerda-sei. 
However Frieza didn't tell Vegeta WHAT world he was destroying, nor did he tell 
Zarbon or Jeice out of fear of a rebellion, not that he couldn't handle such a 
thing, but it meant two more lost 'tools' in his bag of conquest. Zarbon 
however, when killed by Vegeta himself on a world called Namek, had learned of 
the truth of Frieza's deceptive order to Vegeta to destroy Kerda-sei, but knew 
Vegeta had no knowledge of it, so he still feels guilty, as it was Zarbon who 
suggested Frieza destroy the rest of Vegeta's race, the Saiyans, and their home 
planet, Vegeta-sei. Zarbon was brought back from the dead by Quake, the central 
antagonist of Chapter 1, in hopes of his loyal nature to Frieza before making 
him a strong minion. However Zarbon's discovery in the afterlife deterred him 
from having the heart to destroy like he had before, and he fled Quake, not 
thinking he was a true threat due to Quake's assumed insanity. He flees to 
Cronos, and makes allies with Lenako, and they both take over Mika's castle, 
looking for the same treasure that Don and Marcus are looking for, but Don, 
Marcus, Flaid and Mika had prevailed and killed Lenako, and warded Zarbon off. 
Don, Helen, Flaid and Mika find him again later, and they learn the truth that 
Zarbon thought the treasure could help him kill the now-resurrected Frieza, 
revived by Quake after Zarbon turned down Quake's offer, and sent to find, and 
either destroy or convert Zarbon. A long battle took place, and Don's group 
distracted Frieza, while Zarbon proved his goodness by forming a Chou Genki 
Dama, learned from North Kaio in the afterlife after Zarbon had died the first 
time, and with it, destroyed Frieza. Zarbon decided to put aside his differences 
with Don and his group, having a common enemy in Quake. Zarbon is also the one 
who created the 'Polymorph Amulets', which allow members to go to and leave from 
Nemadonus, the game's main base. As a fighter, he has some elemental magic, but 
he mostly wields Ki-based powers like the Kamehameha, Genki Dama, or special 
Physical Combo Skills like Final Uppercut, Final Combo, etc. He also has some 
healing magic, but he's based upon a true fighter's prowess, preferring to use 
Ki or Physical blows to do his enemies in. He is also THE highest in Max HP in 
the whole game, hitting JUST shy of the maximum of 9999 at Level 99[without 
giving him Apples or Soul Spheres I mean]. Zarbon is another person you'll be 
glad is now your friend, and not your enemy...<br>

<b>Tara[Kid Heroine]: <br>
Full Name:</b> Tara Beatrice Tomato<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;Why can't we ever learn from the worst of our mistakes? Our 
races and cultures tear each other apart for nothing but false glories!&quot;</i><br>
<b>Description:</b> A young blue-haired 12-year old girl with an air of purity and 
innocence. However even with these qualities, she is one of THE most powerful 
people on all of Earth, even matching or even surpassing most of the Z-warriors 
of the same world, including Zarbon's old acquaintance Vegeta. Tara is also the 
central protagonist who fought Quake 2 and a half years before this game at the 
tender age of 9. Tara's story is actually decently known: her parents, Rachel 
and Clyde Tomato, raised her for two years, but then vanished the same night to 
different places under various and unexpected circumstances, and Tara was left 
in the care of her parents' best friends, Marcus M. and Joleena M., and her two 
TALKING pets, Plo and Bonnie. Even without her parents for 7 long years, Tara 
lived a nice life, although sadly missing her parents. When Quake first began 
attacking on Earth when she was 9, she learned of evil activity occurring on a 
desert island to her west, and embarked there, even with only the slightest of 
protection, having her father Clyde's heroic spirit. Plo and Bonnie, and Marcus 
M. later followed her in her travels, which she had found her mother Rachel 
trudging through the Heavens Snowfield, under the influence of Quake that she 
had really been dead. Tara had to snap Rachel out of it, gaining her allyship in 
the process, and one piece of her missing family. Tara also learned that she had 
an older cousin named Paula in the country of Eagleland a bit to the Southeast 
of her home. Tara and Paula got to know each other well, and Paula introduced 
Tara to her own friends, Ness, Jeff and Poo. Tara had then learned that 2 years 
ago, the other four had faced a creature of pure evil, much like Quake, known as 
Giygas, and that their experience was well beyond their years. Tara asked Paula 
and the others to help her, learning of Quake's actual involvement recently, and 
it had all led up to a climatic battle in Torrent's Mouth, where Quake had been 
summoning his minions from. Tara also briefly remet her father, Clyde Tomato, 
but he had to fight one of Quake's strongest minions, known as a Shambler, and 
gave up his chance at survival by using a special spell to defeat the guardian, 
allowing Tara to go on to, and then finally defeat Quake with her newly learned 
Final Gate spell, sending Quake into the Dead Zone. Within the recent two years, 
Rachel left again, for reasons unknown, and Tara was again without her parents. 
However after that, an unknown immortal had opened the Dead Zone and taken Quake 
from it, freeing 'Solaris Darkness' and allowing him to make haste to Don's 
world of Cronos, so Tara and her group wouldn't be able to counter Quake's evil 
before he built up enough of it to take over the known universe. Zarbon and 
Flaid manage to contact Marcus M, and he warns her, Plo and Bonnie that Quake is 
back, and attacking from Cronos. After going to the &quot;Tower of Life&quot; just north 
of her home, and use it to reach Winnowing Hall on Cronos, the first site of the 
Hexen Wars 1000 years ago on Cronos, she meets with Don, and finally helping to 
create Nemadonus. In chapter 1, she is THE most important of all of the 
characters, as she is the only one who could stop Quake 2 years ago, and will 
still be the only one to do it now. As an actual fighter, Tara is almost as low 
in HP as Marcus the cat, but has more speed than Mika, more Willpower, but only 
decent defense. However as far as her spells are concerned, she wields a big 
range of powers, from her cousin Paula and some of her friends' PK powers[up to 
Gamma with most], to Magic of almost all elements like Flaid[except Typeless 
spells like Ultima], and even Ki based attacks and Healing. She can wield a 
whole assortment of weapons, most being swords. In most situations, Tara is a 
frickin' life-saver, especially in the later boss fights. A final note is that 
she is immune to Thunder and absorbs Holy attacks, making her extremely useful 
in Chapter 1.<br>

Plo[Talking Cat]: <br>
Full Name:</b> Plo Joseph Tomato<br>
<b>Quote: </b><i>&quot;You wanna call me 'just a cat' again? Perhaps you need your 
ass kicked a bit more!&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Plo is the special TALKING cat of Clyde Tomato, father of Tara, 
and is one of the 3 guardians who watched Tara after Clyde and his wife Rachel 
vanished for 7 long years. Plo, his dog companion Bonnie, and their 'uncle', 
Marcus M., all helped Tara out of the depression of losing her parents so 
suddenly, and took care of her for the longest time. Plo and Bonnie were so 
protective of Tara that they immediately joined her when she embarked to the 
desert island to their west and began their long fight against Quake 2 and a 
half years ago. Plo is pretty serious most of the time, and cares for nothing 
more than his friends' safety. He and Marcus[the cat] tend to have a friendship 
forming, as they seem to be two-of a kind. Plo has about the same amount of HP 
as Marcus the cat, but he has much more TP most of the time than Marcus, and a 
good amount of willpower and speed. His attack and defense aren't the greatest 
though, but Plo can wield Light and Dark elemental spells, Fire and Ice spells, 
and finally, he is one of the only people to learn Big Guard and Malestrom[other 
than Frieza, who also knows Big Guard, and Flaid, who can use Maelstrom]. Plo is 
a good character for offensive magic, and he has SOME healing abilities, but 
physical blows tend to chop away at his life faster than some of the other 
characters, so he must be healed often in battle. Another note, is due to the 
unique breed of cat he is, he is nowhere near the physical age of most cats, and 
is more of 2 in cat years, and raising VERY slowly, so it is possible he could 
even outlive Tara if that much time passes. In fact his age of 36 years in human 
time proves this well, most cats living roughly only 8-11 years at best.<br>
<b><i>[A final note to anyone from the website Starmen.net: The Plo in this game 
is not based off of the Plo of Starmen.net. Strangely enough, I got the name 
'Plo' from a dream 4-5 years ago, but his full name isn't like the Plo of 
SM.net[Ploqzax-something], and he is just called &quot;Plo&quot;.]<br>

returns him to normal power. Be warned, doing this also resets all of the

<b>Bonnie[Talking Dog]: <br>
Full Name:</b> Bonnie Gosalyn Tomato<br>
<b>Quote:</b> <i>&quot;Life is chock-full of surprises. Big and little ones. Me? I'm 
one of the extra-large ones.&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Bonnie is the special TALKING dog of Rachel Tomato, Tara's 
mother, and she is another of the three guardians who watched Tara after her 
parents' vanished. Bonnie is good friends with her cat companion Plo, and even 
better friends with their 'uncle' Marcus M. When around her friends, Bonnie has 
a bit of an outgoing, friendly demeanor, yet she has a very sarcastic attitude 
with her enemies. She hates the lava beast of Quake's called Chthon, and wishes 
to all eternity that he never existed due to a near fatal hit she took from 
Chthon in the first battle with Quake two years ago. However she was also 
Chthon's destroyer in that fight, finishing him off with special made claws of 
electric and wind energy called &quot;Storm Claws&quot;. Bonnie is loyal to Tara, and 
protective of her, and didn't hesitate to help Tara when she had embarked to 
the desert island to the west that led them to their first fight with Quake. As 
a fighter, Bonnie is slightly higher in HP than Flaid[the second highest in HP 
next to Zarbon, or the third highest if you count Cell as well in there]. Bonnie 
also has good attack and defense, and actually has medium high speed and medium 
willpower. She wields Thunder, Water, and later on, Earth and Wind based magic. 
A little known secret is that she has also developed a move she stole from 
Vegeta to an extent, forming a false moon that can increase her strength when 
she looks into it. However unlike Vegeta's, it cannot make her transform into 
anything, but it is nonetheless useful in boss fights when Bonnie needs the 
boost to her stats. Like Plo, her unique breed of dog makes her just as long 
lasting in lifespan as Plo, if not more, so she can likely outlive most of the 
other characters if that much time ever passes. In fact, as shown below, she is 
already about 33 years old in human years, which is more then 3 times the life 
expectancy of the average dog, though she is a little over 3 years younger than 
Plo.<br>

<b>Marcus M.[Mercenary]: </b><br>
<b>Full Name:</b> Marcus Matthew M. <font color="#FFFFFF">(Miguel)</font><br>
<b>Quote:</b> <i>&quot;There is no such thing as a 'terminal limit' for us, only 
temporary limits.&quot;</i><b><br>
Description:</b> Marcus M. was a good friend of Clyde and Rachel Tomato, Tara's 
parents. When Clyde and Rachel vanished, Marcus took it into his own hands to 
help Plo and Bonnie raise Tara. However in most of his spare time, Marcus was 
also a Mercenary who worked for hire, usually fighting off various monsters who 
threatened the less advanced parts of the world. Killing a living human being 
however, was not in his contract. At one point, one of Quake's old generals 
tried to hire Marcus to Quake's side, but Marcus had refused, and may have not 
been able to get out if Tara and Plo and Bonnie not shown up at roughly the same 
time. The four teamed up and destroyed the minion, but they had now put 
themselves within Quake's direct crosshairs, and were being hunted down most of 
the way. Marcus did his darndest to keep the other three safe, fighting with 
special roughhousing techniques, some traces of magic he had learned from other 
monsters, and other special powers he held. When Quake was finally destroyed, it 
had left Tara without her parents again, Clyde having gave up his life in a 
battle with a Shambler, and Rachel leaving for unknown reasons weeks after 
Quake's defeat. Marcus and his wife Joleena again had to take care of Tara, but 
this time, Marcus is the first person on Earth to learn from Flaid and Zarbon's 
messages from Cronos that Quake had returned. He had asked Tara, Plo and Bonnie 
to go to the &quot;Tower of Life&quot; and use the gate nexus to reach Cronos, but he 
feared Quake may have been expecting them this time, and couldn't alert everyone 
else like he had intended to, rushing off right after Tara's group, only to 
reach Cronos and find out they were all fine. Marcus M. had officially joined 
Don's group, and began a slight identity crisis between him, and Marcus the cat, 
who Marcus M. himself finds amusing in his own way. Somehow, when he and Don 
talk, a strange feeling washes over Marcus, like the two of them should know 
each other, but it doesn't seem to click. As a fighter, Marcus has high attack, 
high defense, and High HP. His TP and speed are Mediocre, but his Willpower is a 
bit on the low side. However his magic includes special physical techniques like 
Final Combo, etc, making him a good fighter-type in combat.<br>
