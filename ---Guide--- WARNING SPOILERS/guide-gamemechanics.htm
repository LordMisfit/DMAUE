<p><font size="6">---- V. Getting to Understand the Game ----</font></p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Elements -</font></b></p>
<p>In DMA:UE, there will be plenty of foes that have various strengths and 
Weaknesses against Various Elements or Forms of Physical Attacks, or even Stat 
Altering Spells. There are 5 levels of Resistance in DMA:UE, and they are 
classified by the letters A through E, and there are also several Elements and 
Types of Physical Attacks. Do note that Physical and Magical Elements can be 
applied to skills and magic attacks[Kienzan is Blade-elemental and 
Typeless-elemental, for example], as well as weapons[like the 
Diablo/Glacier/Storm/Holy Water Claws are weapons with elemental attributes]</p>
<p><u><b>Physical Attack Types: [6]<br>
</b></u><b>Blade:</b> Anything like a Sword, an Axe, or even the animal characters' Claw 
weapons qualify under this state. Any bladed weapon meant to be swung in an arc 
works with this.<br>
<b>Piercing:</b> Spears, Some Arrows, Railguns, Bullets and other such weapons 
qualify under this stat.<br>
<b>Blunt:</b> Any Blow that Does Impactive/Shock damage, such as a Bat, Punching, 
Kicking, Gloves, Frying Pans, etc, works with this.<br>
<b>Missile:</b> Any non-Typeless beam weapon fits under this category[mostly applies 
to Jeff's weapons only]. Bottle Rockets also follow this as well.<br>
<b>Metal/Shadow:</b> Applies only to Metal Blades and Shadow Blades, giving them 
their own Unique Type<br>
<b>Noise:</b> Is primarily only used by Noise Crusher, and other minor sound 
attacks. Affects user's resistance to sound-based attacks. Any characters with 
extremely keen senses of hearing will normal be really weak in this area[i.e. 
Vegeta, Cell, Flaid, Bonnie, etc].</p>
<p><u><b>Magic Elements: [10]<br>
</b></u><b>Fire:</b> Anything made from extreme Hot Elements<br>
<b>Ice:</b> Anything made from extreme Cold Elements<br>
<b>Thunder:</b> Anything with an Electrical Attribute<br>
<b>Water:</b> Anything Liquid in Nature<br>
<b>Earth:</b> Anything composed of Extremely Hard Surfaces and Rocks<br>
<b>Air:</b> Wind Energy<br>
<b>Holy:</b> Light-Based Energy<br>
<b>Dark:</b> Evil-Based Energy<br>
<b>Poison:</b> Anything toxic in nature and capable of inflicting Poison-related 
ailments.<br>
<b>Typeless:</b> Anything that is a 'Non-Elemental' or 'Neutral' Energy[Furea 
attacks, Ultima attacks, etc]. Do be noted that most enemies have a B Typeless 
rating, which is natural vulnerability to it. Some enemies can resist or even be 
immune to it, but NO ENEMY in DMA:UE can ABSORB Typeless spells, unless under 
very special circumstances.</p>
<p><u><b>Stat Types: [5]<br>
</b></u><b>Attack:</b> Effects How Much Attack Power you Lose From Attack Reduction Spells<br>
<b>Defense:</b> Same as above, except for Defense<br>
<b>Mind:</b> Same as above, except for Willpower<br>
<b>Agility:</b> Same as above, except for Speed<br>
<b>Absorb:</b> Anything that Absorbs from one target to transfer to another.</p>
<p><b><u>Vulnerability Levels:<br>
</u><font color="#E02040">A</font></b> - The Character or Enemy is Weak to the Attribute, and will Usually take 
200% Damage from it, except for physical attacks, which do 400% damage.<br>
<font color="#C40000"><b>B</b></font> - The Character or Enemy takes Normal Damage from the attack if it's a 
magic element, and will take 200% from a physical attack.<br>
<font color="#006000"><b>C</b></font> - The Character or Enemy takes 50% Damage from the attack if it's a magic 
element, and will take Normal Damage from a physical or stat attributed attack.<br>
<font color="#200080"><b>D</b></font> - The Character or Enemy is immune to the attack if it's a magic element, 
and will take 50% Damage from a physical attack.<br>
<font color="#800080"><b>E</b></font> - The Character or Enemy will absorb the element in question and heal 
themself, and will take nothing for stat attacks, and they will only take 1% 
damage for weapon attacks. It is not a good idea to use attacks on enemies that 
can absorb them, as it will only make your battles harder.</p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u><i> There are spells known as Nul[blaze, frost, shock, tide, quake, gust, 
light, dark, nuke, venom, sound] and Dis[blaze, frost, shock, tide, quake, gust, 
light, dark, nuke, venom, sound]. The 'Nul' spells increase their respective 
element's resistance for the targeted character by one level, if the resistance 
isn't already level E(so using Nulfrost on Mika will increase her resistance 
from B to C, which makes her take less Ice damage]. The 'Dis' spells will 
DECREASE the respective element's resistance by a level, unless the level is 
already A[the weakest anyone can be at]. A character can only go to either one 
level above, or one level below their initial resistance level for each 
element[if Don has a B resistance to Missile weapons, he can only be at A, B or 
C, and cannot go to D or E].</i></p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Negative Statuses/Ailments -</font></b></p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u><i> The Following Ailments are affected by character resistances, which 
work similar to elemental resistances[A, B, C, D and E levels]</i></p>
<p><font color="#D49D9D"><b>Comatose</b></font> - The Character is at 0 HP, and is rendered unable to act on their 
own will. There are several methods that can raise them to their feet. This can 
also be inflicted instantly by various spells such as Kienzan, PK Flash, Death, 
Degeon, etc. Do not let everyone gain this status, or it's game over[or if it's a 
random battle, you'll lose some of your EXP if you choose to continue]. :P<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Poison</b></font> - The character will lose 2% + 4 of their HP every time someone takes 
their turn. <br>
<b><font color="#75B9F5">Blind</font></b> - Lowers the character's overall hit rate to only 20%, making most of 
their attacks miss, even skills.<br>
<font color="#53AA76"><b>Silence</b></font> - Locks all of the affected character's skills.<br>
<font color="#F7E769"><b>Berserk</b></font> - Character will rage out of control, attacking enemies on their own 
in combat, however their attack is always double of it's normal value when 
afflicted with this.<br>
<font color="#EDB6ED"><b>Chaos</b></font> - Character will lose control over their body and attack allies or 
themselves at random on their turn. Getting hit can rescind the effects of this 
ailment.<br>
<font color="#FCCD80"><b>Sleep</b></font> - Prevents the character's ATB bar from moving, keeping them from 
taking their turn until awake. They will also recover 1% + 4 HP, and 5 TP on 
each turn. A good hit can normally wake them up.<br>
<font color="#FCCD80"><b>Numb</b></font> - Prevents character's ATB bar from moving, but much harder to abate 
than Sleep, and will usually require an item or spell to remove.<br>
<font color="#B2F08F"><b>Shock</b></font> - Stops the person's ATB bar for one turn. Can be annoying when 
inflicted on a character that is just about to take their turn. :P<br>
<font color="#DCA2F5"><b>MindBlow</b></font> - The character will lose 2% + 1 of their TP every time someone takes 
their turn.<br>
<font color="#D2F07A"><b>Scared</b></font> - Reduces Hit Rate to 66% and also halves Defense and Attack until 
lifted.<br>
<font color="#C89152"><b>Malestro</b></font> - The character will lose all but 1 HP, and all of their TP on the 
next turn[but the status will lift too]. It can be sometimes countered by that 
next turn being used to fully heal the afflicted person, but can be nasty if the 
next turn taken is by an enemy with an all-hitting spell.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>H. Poison</b></font> - The character will lose 12% + 24 HP of their HP per 
turn. This is a very nasty upgrade of the normal Poison ailment.<br>
<b><font color="#C89152">Bleeding</font></b> - Identical to Poison in damage, however much more easily inflicted 
by characters or enemies, due to most of their bladed weapons.<br>
<font color="#EDB6ED"><b>Cursed-D</b></font> - Hit Percentage drops to 75%, Defense is cut in half, and any 
skills above an influence of 8 will be locked.<br>
<font color="#EDB6ED"><b>Cursed-K</b></font> - Hit Percentage drops to 50%, Defense and Mind are cut in half, and 
any skills above an influence of 5 will be locked.<br>
<font color="#EDB6ED"><b>Cursed-E</b></font> - Hit Percentage drops to 25%, Attack, Defense and Mind are cut in 
half, and any skills above an influence of 2 will be locked.<br>
<font color="#6D96B1"><b>Slow</b></font> - Speed is halvened. Exact opposite of Haste.<br>
<font color="#D49D9D"><b>Stop</b></font> - Identical to Numb and Shock, stopping the victim's ATB bar, except it 
cannot be healed and lasts 16 turns.<br>
<font color="#B2F08F"><b>Weakened</b></font> - Attack, Defense, Mind and Agility are cut in half, the character's 
hit rate is lessened to 75%, and they will lose 5% of their TP per turn.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Plague</b></font> - Rare, but NASTY ailment. Halves Attack, Defense, Mind and Agility. 
Lessens hit rate to 10%, and the character will lose 24% + 32 of their HP, and 
36% + 44 of their TP per turn. Also, their techniques become locked completely, 
with the exception of skills with no levels of influence. This also makes the 
character automatically attack enemies on their next turn. Wears off within 32 
turns.<br>
<b><font color="#AAEDC5">Possess</font></b> - The character is basically possessed by an enemy, and will attack 
allies or themselves on random. It cannot be abated through an attack, and will 
not wear off for 128 turns. Only Pure Water can cure Possess, but the status is 
also rare in return, so you may not have to ever worry about this ailment.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Positive Statuses -</font></b></p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u><i> The Following Statuses are NOT affected by character resistances and 
always hit regardless.</i></p>
<p><font color="#CABCF5"><b>100%</b></font> - First introduced to us by Frieza, this status will double Attack, 
Defense, Mind and Agility, but knock your hit percentage to 87%, sometimes 
making you miss at critical moments. Usually, only Frieza's 'Go 100%' skill, or 
a Frieza Sigil can give this to you.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Reflect</b></font> - Repels any skills used on that character. Note that this 
particular version of the condition is permanent, usually given by an item. 
Also, note that when fighting enemies, skills invoked by using items will BYPASS 
an enemy's reflect status[a bug I believe in RM2K3 itself].
<font color="#FF0000"><u><b>WARNING:</b></u></font> When 
fighting the Gold Centaur in the Illusion Forest[below], do NOT have Bonnie or 
Plo attack with enemy-targeting skills. They will get reflected at non-existent 
characters somehow and crash the game.<br>
<b><font color="#FCCD80">Reflect</font></b> - Repels any skills used on that character. Note that this 
particular version of the condition will wear off within 48 turns, however. 
Also, note that when fighting enemies, skills invoked by using items will BYPASS 
an enemy's reflect status[a bug I believe in RM2K3 itself].<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Imaged</b></font> - All physical moves will miss this person, all the time. This 
version is permanent, usually given by an item.<br>
<font color="#FCCD80"><b>Imaged</b></font> - All physical moves will miss this person, all the time. This 
version however only lasts as long as 48 turns.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Guarded</b></font> - Defense, Mind and Agility are doubled, and character will 
recover 4% of their TP every turn. This version is permanent, usually given by 
an item.<br>

recover 4% of their TP every turn. Will wear off in 36 turns.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Haste</b></font> - Agility is doubled. This version is permanent, given usually by 
items.<br>
<font color="#FCCD80"><b>Haste</b></font> - Agility is doubled. Lasts 48 turns at max.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>Protesu</b></font> - Defense is doubled. Permanent and invoked via items.<br>

items[Muscle Sigil].<br>
<font color="#EDB6ED"><b>Offensed</b></font> - Attack is Doubled. Can only be invoked through items.<br>
<font color="#75B9F5"><b>Deity</b></font> - Only the Embrosia Box[after Quake is captured] can add this. Attack, 
Defense, Mind and Agility are doubled, the character evades all attacks and 
skills[except Self-Destruct attacks], and recovers 100% of their HP and their TP 
per turn.<br>
<b><font color="#B2F08F">Expand</font></b> - Doubles Attack, Defense, Mind and Agility. Lasts the entire battle 
it's used in.<br>
<font color="#B2F08F"><b>Compress</b></font> - Exact opposite of Expand. Halves Attack, Defense, Mind and 
Agility and lasts the entire fight. (it's not a &quot;positive&quot; status, but there's 
no way to build a resistance to it, so it's listed here anyways)<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>1/8Regen</b></font> - Character recovers 1% + 8 of their HP per turn. Only used on 
bosses and enemies.<br>
<font color="#CABCF5"><b>1/4Regen</b></font> - Character recovers 2% + 16 of their HP per turn. Only used on

<font color="#C89152"><b>Adrenal</b></font> - Only inflicted with AB-Stims. Doubles Attack and Agility, lessens 
hit rate to 99%, and the character recovers 20% of their HP and 5% of their TP 
per turn.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Basic Items -</font></b></p>
<p><b>Potion</b> - Restores 250 HP to one person. Basic healing chemicals and herbs 
inside.<br>
<b>KeroKeroCola</b> - Said to have descended from space, these strange, almost 
Earth-like drinks have landed all over the known universe. Their powerful [not 
to mention tasty] healing properties can fully restore the HP and TP of the 
entire party. However, they are not capable of lifting one from unconsciousness, 
or curing ailments.<br>
<b>Crystal Vial</b> - These vials of purple lifeblood are still hanging around even 
2000 years later after the Hexen wars! They are however more potent than the 
original versions of themselves, and so plentiful, not to mention no longer 
fragile like their Hexen War counterparts that had to be used on the fly, that 
they are seen in various shops on Cronos. They will restore 10% of the entire 
party's HP AND TP when used.<br>
<b>Quartz Flask</b> - Like the vials, but they are larger, and more sturdy than 
ever. These Flasks of lifeblood have not only increased in healing power, but 
also potential, now able to heal 30% of the party's HP AND TP, as opposed to the 
original 25% of someone's HP they were known for in the wars.<br>
<b>Mystic Urn</b> - Another of the ancient healing relics of the Hexen Wars, their 
powers have changed over the millennia. Although their base healing power is no 
longer a full 100% of life, they however will cure 75% of the party's HP AND TP, 
PLUS they have the new-found ability to restore the unconscious, and are even 
rumored to be able to lift the dead from their eternal rest... if they have not 
died very recently and their body is still intact.<br>
<b>Apple</b> - Not just your average Red Apples, these strange fruits can 
permanently extend one's HP by 2 points. They are also commonly found on various 
enemies around Cronos, and especially for some reason, Cyberdemons.<br>
<b>TP Apple</b> - These more purple skinned Apples are similar to their red 
counterparts, except they are able to extend one's TP by 2 points. Also a common 
item that some enemies, especially Cacodemons, tend to drop then they are slain.<br>
<b>Soul Sphere</b> - Said to be taken from a strange world of mystical demons, these 
bluish spheres have the spiritual essence of another's lost soul, as indicated 
by the screaming face that appears within it. These spheres, when used, will 
free the souls trapped within them, however the soul will award the user by 
extending their HP and TP by 50 each.<br>
<b>Quad Damage MK. II</b> - These strange, Q-Shaped symbols have of recently been 
appearing in numbers on the world of Cronos. Their powers and origins are 
unknown for the most part, and many scholars are baffled to their new 
appearance. It is said, their power can amplify your own powers, but at a small 
price.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Weapon Skills -</font></b></p>
<p>Some weapons have addition powers when they are equipped by your characters. 
To use these powers, you have to find the equipped weapon in the items section 
of the battle menu. If it is highlighted, then the item has a special skill. If 
it's darkened out, then it does not have a special use, or you are not using the 
character with this item equipped.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Brown Chests - </font></b> </p>
<p>Even though you can't beat up chests and such in the game, the brown ones in 
particular can be quite a pain, since they can, and usually WILL contain enemies 
in them. Also, Brown Chests can usually be searched up to three times, and 
sometimes there are even hidden 'Clerk Demons' inside of them, that will allow 
you to buy and sell special items, however to find these rare demons, you must 
completely purge the chest of other evils. Also, coins are usually found in most 
brown chests, and even some strange items and equipment. A couple of rarer Brown 
chests also even contain very powerful and ancient enemies. However these 
particular chests will usually be sealed and locked, giving the wary adventurer 
a warning before they open the chest accidentally and release Hell into the 
universe again. Even more, some Brown Chests can contain traps that damage your 
party, or even permanently affect their stats in a positive OR negative way. Be 
warned, especially since on Very Hard and EXTREMELY Hard difficulties[below] 
these chests can be very dangerous to you.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Difficulty Levels -</font></b></p>
<p>DMA:UE is an unique game in the fact that it multiplies it's replay value by 
4[6 if you play the whole thing] due to it's six separate difficulty levels. The 
idea of this is so DMA:UE can be played by beginners, or by standard RPG 
players, or even by Veteran players. The levels are:</p>
<p><font color="#003399"><b>VERY Easy (0) -</b></font> We know you're not THIS pathetic of a player, no matter how new 
you are. That's why this skill level is hidden. You are obscenely lucky and have 
a HORRENDOUS advantage over most enemies. In fact, most monsters in the first 
half of the game are too scared to even attack you. :P<br>
<font color="#009933"><b>Easy (1) -</b></font> For Beginners[usually little kids and grandparents :P]. You have a 
serious advantage over most of your foes.<br>
<b>Normal (2) -</b> For the common, but not fanatic RPG players to play. The game is on 
totally fair terms between you AND enemies.<br>
<font color="#FF9966"><b>Hard (3) -</b></font> For more hardcore RPG players, who are more fanatic than normal skill 
players, but not blood-sucking leeches about it. Things are noticeably harder, 
but nothing compared with...<br>
<font color="#FF6600"><b>Very Hard (4) -</b></font> For the hardcorest of the hardcore RPG Zealots! This level will 
deal out punishment in spades, and you must be very patient and slow to anger to 
handle this. Do not play on this level too long at a time if you have a short 
fuse. Good items are rare to find in the game for the situation your party is 
in. Brown Chests also tend to be particularly nasty adversaries on this skill too.<br>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>EXTREMELY Hard (5) -</b></font> So Mind-Numbingly annoying and testing on the brain that 
like VERY Easy level, it's also hidden. On this skill, some hidden items are 
completely absent, and the enemy groups can be insanely hard. If you get annoyed 
easily with Very Hard, this is definitely NOT for you. If you are patient enough 
to play this level... then GOOD LUCK. You're gonna freakin' need it.<br>
<b><font color="#660066">Challenge (6) -</font> </b>Identical in difficulty 
level to EXTREMELY Hard, except there is one major difference. Normally in any 
game, you have the ability to save ANYWHERE in the game. However on Challenge 
mode, you will NOT be allowed to save, except on specfic points(usually healing 
stars). Although you might be able to find special items that give you a free 
save, don't expect it to be easy.</p>
<p>The Skill Level will normally affect the follow attributes of the game:<br>
- Starting Money<br>
- The types of items that can be found hidden or in chests[the harder the 
level, the less useful the items, etc]<br>
- The Rate of Battle Encounters[the higher the level, the more frequent 
you'll go into battles on the maps]<br>
- The Behavior patterns of most normal-level enemies[enemies have more potent 
attacks in the higher difficulties]<br>
- Brown Chest Monster Parties[the higher the level, the more powerful the 
monsters that come from Brown Chests]<br>
- Money Found in Chests/Etc[the higher the level, the less money you receive]<br>
- Inn Prices[again, the higher the level, the more expensive inns are]<br>
- Various Stores in the Game[the higher the level, the less useful items and 
equipment that are sold. This does not apply to most stores, but there are still 
some affected by this]</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Alternate Routes -</font></b></p>
<p>Another small feature of DMA:UE is that when you beat the game, you can get a 
special confirmation code that you can enter upon starting a new game. This code 
allows various 'Alternate Routes' to become possible, which can alter a 
character's path slightly, but enough to make a decent enough impression. For 
example, when you begin the game, you normally can attain Mika as your fourth 
character and help her take back through Janepo Ninja Castle and save her friend 
Jean, but if you enter the right confirmation code, and then break the Water 
Stone on the cliff when you first examine it, you'll change things ever 
slightly, but enough that Jean will be in Mika's place, and he'll join you 
instead, going to rescue Mika instead. The game takes an interesting turn when 
you go down an alternate path, and you can see things about certain characters 
you didn't normally know. You cannot access the choices that can lead to 
alternate routes unless you entered the right confirmation code at the 
beginning.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Passwords -</font></b></p>
<p>Passwords are another form of replay value. Beating the game on certain 
difficulty modes can also award you with a string of 21 numbers, all in 3 groups 
of seven, that are actually a password to something unique. For example, one 
password accesses a Cheater's mode, where you can alter a character's Level or 
Experience through various key commands, or use a key to change your party to 
any characters you want, even ones not accessible at the current point in the 
game.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Confirmation Codes -</font></b></p>
<p>These are 4-digit codes that are entered with the number keys after you are 
prompted. Several of these codes exist. One code gives you the I. Tracer, an 
item that allows you to detect where items are hidden on the ground in the game. 
Another code is for the alternate routes mode[explained above]. Another code can 
also be for a &quot;Extended Mode&quot;, which allows you to see various events from a 
different character's vantage point. One possible path will allow you to control 
Marcus up until he meets Don at what would normally be the beginning of the 
game, or controlling Flaid to the point he meets Don, etc. This can allow the 
player to learn even more about a character and extend the story further than 
normal[much like deleted scenes on a DVD edition of a movie, etc].</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Losing Random Battles -</font></b></p>
<p>In most RPGs, when you get defeated completely it will usually result in a 
game over, however in DMA:UE, it is possible to bounce back from complete defeat 
in most situations[except for most plot-important battles and bosses]. However 
it is not necessarily free as it will cost all your party a specific % of their 
current EXP[depends on skill level] to bring everyone to their feet[possibly 
causing them to bump back 1 or 2 levels], plus the fact that they only wake up, 
and do not actually heal[meaning your group is left with 1 HP and whatever TP 
they had when they were KOed whenever you're lifted from total defeat]. When you 
are lifted to your feet, you will return to where you were when you got defeated 
on the current map, so do well to have healing items or be as close to a source 
of healing when you do this, or you might find yourself using it a lot. Also, 
you'll lose half your money in the earlier parts of the game when this happens. 
After Ness joins you and you gain the ATM Card though, you'll only lose 1/10 of 
any on-hand cash you have when this happens.</p>
<p><b><a name="AutoHeal"><font size="4">- Auto Healing -</font></a></b></p>
<p>Out of battle, every 3-5 seconds, your party will automatically recover a 
small part of their lost HP and TP. They will slightly glow and make a jingle 
noise to indicate this. As the game progresses, the occurrence of auto-healing 
will slowly increase in speed. Additionally, each secret character successfully 
gained in the game also speeds up the auto-healing rate by 0.2 seconds(up to 
+0.6 seconds). Also, the amount of HP 
you heal is equal to 1 for every 200 Max HP a character has. At max, a character 
can recover 50 HP per healing interval. The amount of TP you recover is equal to 
1 for every 100 TP, meaning as much as 10 TP can be recovered per interval at 
max. If your characters have under 200 HP, they will still recover 1 HP every 
interval, but the same will not apply for TP if you have less than 100 of them.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- Mini Maps and the Position Finder -</font></b></p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, Marcus will give you the 'Map Scroll' upon 
joining you. This can be used with the '1' key, which will pop up a miniature 
map of the area you're in. A bit later, you'll be able to buy the 'position 
finder' from Helen, which is primarily used to track your position on the mini 
map with a tiny icon, which looks like the face of your lead character. 
Sometimes and in some large areas, it can also detect key items, or some 
enemies. It is a vital item when your chasing Neo Shaft around in West City to 
retrieve Bulma's spaceship plans, due to how dang huge the city is, and with how 
fast Shaft moves around on the map. It's also good to use in Shademan's 
Temple[in which finding the cross key pieces is hard in the underground maze], 
and Quake's cavern[in which Quake's position will also be revealed on the 
mini-map if he's still active]. In addition, the 'Space Map' can be upgraded to 
be a lot more detailed version if you go to Planet Cold and retrieve the 
galaxial maps Frieza mentioned before. The map will be outlined with the various 
boundaries of each major galaxy, including Milky Way, Pegasus, Maetel, 
Andromeda, Rosetta, Thor, Horus, Zeus, etc, and when you hover over a planet or 
station, a pop-up message will tell you what place you've reached.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- The Spaceship -</font></b></p>
<p>After defeating all 8 main Robot Masters that serve the Jikuba, you will in 
some way or another be required to find a spaceship, whether it'd be to 
accomplish Marcus's request to take him to him Dainjora colony of Anubis, or it 
to go to Santranus to find Sandra and get her help. When this point in the game 
occurs, Vegeta's wife Bulma will be discovered to be building you a spaceship in 
advance for this occasion. Upon getting it, it will double as an airship on the 
world maps, and with the Shift Key, you can ascend/descend between space and 
planets. This significantly reduces travel time between distant worlds and 
areas, and you can even go inside of the ship, enhance it's speed with various 
items later on, etc. It will also come with a special remote teleporter than can 
teleport the ship to you on the world map if you left it somewhere you can't 
reach or are too lazy to go get it on your own. Also, in some areas in the game, 
using the Remote will have the ship appear and teleport you inside, where you 
can fly it from that position[a tribute to the original demos of DMA made by 
Don].</p>
<p><b><font size="4">- General Tips -</font></b></p>
<p>1. Get to understand how the &quot;Reflect&quot; status really works in the game. Also, 
you should be aware that only one member in a group of members or enemies has to 
be 'Reflect'ed to deflect all-target hitting spells, as opposed to all the 
members like in most RPGs, so if you know the enemy you're fighting mainly uses 
dangerous all-hitting spells like Ultima, shielding a single character is just 
as effective as shielding all of your members. Also, in addition, when fighting 
'Reflect'ed enemies, use ITEMS instead of spells on them. Items that cast skills 
do not get deflected. Also, do not attempt to attack an enemy with reflect with 
skills, lest you risk crashing the game due to the engine's bugs. :\</p>
<p>2. Also, there are times, using Reflect may not be as helpful as you might 
initially think. Many of the later enemies in the game[Chthon, Spark Mandrill, 
Goddess, Poltergeist, etc] use skills which are normally the same elementals as 
the ones they are immune to, or more importantly, ones that can be ABSORBED. In 
the latter situation for example, Poltergeist can use Faiga and have it deflect 
on him and HEAL himself instead of hurting him, which stymies the effectiveness 
of your shields, especially when your doing little damage to the specific enemy 
in the first place. In these situations, if possible, use a Dis[elemental] spell 
that corresponds to the elementals that enemy can absorb. It will alter it that 
the enemy will only be immune and take 0 damage from the element[s], as opposed 
to healing from it/them. It might not allow the deflected spells to actually 
damage the enemies using them, but at least they won't be healing themselves 
anymore. If you do not have a Dis[elemental] spell of the right type in your 
group, try to use Disperu [Ally] or Disperura [Ally] to remove the shield[s]. 
You'll get damaged again by the spells, but there's not much else you can do in 
that situation if the shielding will only end up healing the enemies anyways.</p>
<p>3. Remember, all HP-draining ailments will NOT kill or knock out their 
victims, and will reduce them as low as 1 HP. This is important against enemies 
you have poisoned, or have caused to bleed, as you can see their status 
condition by using a single-target attack/skill. If they are not losing HP and 
they still have the ailment[s] causing it/them in question, it means they have 1 
HP left and will take only one more hit to kill. However you cannot see damage 
done to TP for enemies or players in the same manner as HP, and they will be 
drained to 0 TP by such conditions like Weakened or Plague.</p>
<p>4. If you have been 'Malestro'ed, it means on the next turn taken by ANYONE, 
the victim will lose all but 1 HP and all TP, so if one of your character goes 
up next, have them use a healing item/skill on the affected person to 
immediately counter the lost HP/TP. Malestro will dissipate after one turn, so it 
will not constantly zap the victim to near-death.</p>
<p>5. Being put to sleep isn't all bad. You may not be able to use the affected 
character, but they will slowly heal HP/TP on each turn taken by anyone in 
combat, so by the time they wake up, they might be much stronger and may even 
have their TP filled back up. This is nice for Marcus early in the game when he 
has to use moves and then gets hit by a Blue Male Guard's Sleep Kick attack, so 
he'll end up recovering the vital TP he just had to use.</p>

<p>6. If you're in a bad situation, such as up against an enemy who can wipe out 
most of your group with one specific attack or skill, the best option you have 
is to have your best healer Defend, and the others attack the enemy. The Defend 
command is extremely useful in DMA:UE, capable of cutting damage by 75%, even 
from skills and magic spells, so even Ultima in it's stronger form will likely 
not kill a high-leveled character in defense mode. This skill is extremely 
useful during the Zarbon and Frieza battles at certain points. Defend is also 
essential to survival against foes like Cacovirgil or the Vampris.</p>
