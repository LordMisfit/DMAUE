<p><font size="6">--- X. How to get the codes for each mode ---</font></p>
<p><b>Extended Mode:</b> To get the code for Extended Mode, just beat the game on 
normal in any form(no special requirements have to be completed)<br>
<b>Alternate Routes:</b> To get the code for Alternate Route Mode, find Cell, Frieza 
and Sandra during the same playthrough and then beat it.<br>
<b>I. Tracer:</b> Buy the I. Tracer itself in the Casino's VIP Room #2 for 
10,000 CAPs. You'll immediately get the 
confirmation code as opposed to getting it at the end of the game.</p>
<p><u><b>Note:</b></u> <i>If you get codes for more than one mode, you'll get 
additional codes that combine modes and/or use of items.</i></p>
