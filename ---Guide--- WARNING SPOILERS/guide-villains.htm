<p><br>
The Jikuba, &quot;Demons of the Apocalypse&quot;: The Jikuba are actually in truth, 
mostly Lenako's original army of monsters who helped her and Zarbon stage the 
takeover of Mika's castle. Marcus[the cat] first actually brings up their name, 
and Zarbon is impressed at Marcus's ability to get around. The Jikuba are mostly 
consistent of Cacodemons, Barons of Hell, N'Garai Daemonites, Archons of Hell, 
CyberDemons, CyberDemon Ghosts, Super CyberDemons, Korax's old Centaurs and 
Slaughtaurs, and various other demonic agents. Lenako is actually in truth the 
central leader of most of the Jikuba, and gave partial command of them over to 
Zarbon when they had teamed up, thus Zarbon gained some of the more powerful 
soldiers, such as the Super CyberDemons you face just outside of, and also 
within his Throne Room in the early part of the game. The Jikuba will appear all 
throughout the game, even with Lenako destroyed and Zarbon on your side. Another 
note is that the 'generals' of the Jikuba are 'copies' of the Robot Masters of 
Dr. Albert William Wily, a mad robotist on Earth who has been trying to take 
over the planet countless times, and always failed, and perhaps even he owes 
SOME form of allegiance to the Jikuba, but we do not know yet...</p>

Lenako, Double Agent:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="shadowman.gif" width="88"><br>
Shadowman, Master Robot Ninja: Shadow Man considers himself to be the master of 
deception, everything he does or says carefully calculated to produce a desired 
result. He is a robotic ninja, a warrior who strikes without being seen or 
heard, and devotes most of his spare time to perfecting his skills. Experience 
has taught him loyalty to Lenako and the Jikuba, but he has no other morals. His 
nature is often quiet and contemplative, allowing actions to substitute for 
words, aside from a sardonic comment here and there. Serves as one of the 
primary sources of intelligence for the Jikuba, using both his disguises and 
unique ability to fade into the shadows. He is armed with large Shurikens called 
Shadow Blades, along with a variety of both ancient and modern weapons and 
martial arts techniques, making him a deadly foe. Considered strange by the 
majority of the Jikuba, he is nonetheless their most powerful general, having 
created weaker copies of himself to face with those foes he believes to his be 
inferiors. This tactic is handy when Shadowman wishes to gain information on a 
potential threat.</p>

Quake, a.k.a. &quot;Solaris Darkness&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Eternal Evil&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;The First&quot;: 
It is said Quake is one of the most powerful evil beings in the known depths of 
the universe, many claiming that he is a physical manifestation of 0.01% of the 
dark entity Lord Minion's evil that was required to be expelled from him to give 
him a 'Yin-Yang' balance. Even being only 0.01% of Minion's power, Quake is one 
of the most deadly creatures to ever roam our solar system, being able to summon 
legions and hoards of the most gruesome, horrid, and despicable creatures known 
to our imaginations, such as the malignant Strogg, lead by the Makron, or the 
Volcano Beast, Chthon, commanding the element of fire, or even being able to 
steal good natured souls from Heaven, like Xaero, and make them fight his own 
foes for the stolen souls to regain the right to return to where they belong. 
Quake has bounded many creatures to his own whims, and many have fallen at the 
hands of his legions. However what is the shocker about Quake is that despite 
having a physical form, he is incorporeal, and intangible, meaning he is 
unkillable as his natural state. Because of this, Tara could not actually kill 
Quake, and had to use the Final Gate spell to banish Quake into the Dead Zone, 
where he could not leave, since he could not summon beings that could survive 
the Dead Zone's climate long enough to open a counter-gate, and because he was 
harmless on his own. However, after two years, the Dark Priest Shaft, an 
immortal magician, opened a gate of his own to the Dead Zone from the outside, 
and found Quake and realized who he was, taking him back with him into the 
physical reality, and then at Quake's discretion, went to Don's world of Cronos 
to stage an 'out-of-reach' attack against Tara and her friends on Earth. However 
Don's group inadvertently at first began to shatter the pieces of Quake's plan 
one by one, starting with the befriending of Zarbon, then the first death of 
Frieza, and then calling Tara to Cronos and causing Quake to lose his important 
advantage of distance. It is said that the lost Maverick from the distant 
future, Spark Mandrill, during the first attack of Quake's, had found the mystic 
EMBROSIA BOX, a box capable of completely containing Quake's physical and 
spiritual forms and powers, effectively creating a &quot;Dead Zone&quot; in a box. Tara 
and Spark fought a rehash of a battle they had 2 years ago when she had met him 
in a group of ice caves on her journey to meet Quake, and won the box from him, 
and his friendship and his understanding of the true nature of the human race, 
and the many good and bad apples of such, but then Mandrill self-destructed due 
to grievous damage from Tara, thus shattering the final piece of Quake's plan. 
Through the box, Tara finally defeats Quake with it at the end of chapter 1. One 
other note about Quake is that at his true power, he could take the form of any 
being he desires, and use his or her powers against his enemies in direct 
combat. Also, Quake's powers are limited over long distances and that if he is 
projecting himself over a distance of planets, that he can only assume the form 
of the dead, rather they were revived from death or not however he is still 
incorporeal and intangible, and unable to attack in this state, just like 
normally]. It is rumored Quake had attempted yet another attack on Earth before 
his full-scale one when Tara was 9, trying to release the hideous and vampric wave of 
&quot;Turok-Han&quot; over the world, but had been stopped barely by a now unknown 
group of individuals, and that these people referred to him as &quot;The First&quot;, 
likely due to his being a tiny part of Lord Minion's essence, who himself was 
the first real evil to exist, thus Quake shared his position as &quot;The First 
Evil&quot;. His other well known nickname is &quot;Solaris Darkness&quot;, as Marcus M. 
normally calls him, which also means &quot;Eternal Evil&quot;.</p>

The Serpent Rider, D'Sparil:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="korax.gif" width="96"><br>
The Serpent Rider, Korax: Korax is an integral part of the history of Don's 
world of Cronos, being the middle-aged of the trio of legendary Serpent Riders, 
three evil brothers who set out across the depths of the universe, enslaving 
worlds for their own amusement and fun. Korax is the most important rider in 
DMA:UE because of his connection to Cronos. He was the rider who attempted to 
invade Cronos over 1000 years ago. He was able to take over the minds of Zedek, 
Marshal of the Legion, Traductus, Grand Patriarch of the Church, and Melenkir, 
Arch-Mage of the Arcanum, granting him instant rule over most of the world. 
Korax and his legions exterminated most of the resistance that could've faced 
him, and the 'Grandmasters', an elitist sect of rulers who established the rules 
when Magic was discovered on Cronos. However one man from each of the societies 
survived Korax's attack, known as Baratus of the Legion, Daedolon of the 
Arcanum, and Parias of the Church. In the end, the three humans ultimately 
destroyed Korax and returned peace to Cronos for over 950 years[the events of 
the original Hexen game]. However, even with Korax gone, pockets of his vastly 
devastated armies survive, joining forces with Lenako's 'Jikuba'. Apparently 
they see promise in her ideals, but what they are as of yet is unknown, and 
Korax's essence is still scattered around the whole of Cronos, thus it's 
possible he might be returned to life someday.</p>

The Serpent Rider, Eidolon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="charon.gif" width="96"><br>
The Lord of Darkness/Son of Chaos, Charon:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="erebus.gif" width="96"><br>
The Agent/Embodiment of Chaos, Erebus: Erebus is considered to be the 
official 'final boss' of DMA:UE, even though you can end up fighting Lord Minion 
in addition if you're in extended mode. Erebus is considered by all that have 
heard his name to be the Embodiment of Chaos, much as Giygas was the Embodiment 
of Evil. He was once a lighter-natured being, who once lived in a universe well 
beyond the original DMA universe. However, he and his three sons, D'Sparil, 
Eidolon and Korax had staged an attempt to overthrow Erebus's ally, Mordoc, the 
Vanguard of Order. They were defeated, and put on trial. Mordoc sentenced all 
four to banishment into a realm known as &quot;Tartarus&quot;, where their spirits would 
remain in a limbo state. As for Erebus, Mordoc additionally condemned him to a 
process know as the &quot;Darkening&quot;, which meant to bind one's soul to an artifact 
of sorts. Even if the artifact is shattered or destroyed, the soul is still 
bound to the fragments. Erebus was bound to his own creation, the Chaos Sphere, 
in fact the very same one that both Eidolon and then Korax used in their later 
attempts to overthrow Thyrion and Cronos, and Erebus was sent into Tartarus. 
However by ironic luck, an aether traveling magician accidentally cracked the 
field of power blocking our universe from Tartarus, allowing the riders, and 
eventually Erebus to escape. After recovering their lost energy from the 
encounter in Tartarus, Erebus sent his sons into the more chaotic universe. 
However, when he learned of D'Sparil and Eidolon's defeats, he specifically 
entrusted Korax with a reconstructed Chaos Sphere and told him to locate him a 
throneworld to rule from. Korax would pick Cronos as that throneworld, but would 
be destroyed before he could pave the way for Erebus to arrive, thus vastly 
hampering Erebus's plans. Also, the shattering of the Chaos Sphere dealt a 
direct blow to Erebus's mental state, his mind having been bound directly to the 
Sphere upon both it and Korax's destruction, causing him to go catatonic for 
1500 years. After his awakening, he realizes that he needs to find a way to 
resurrect all three of his sons, realizing that despite his mind being active, 
his body is all but dead. He needs his sons' spirits to reawaken himself 
physically, in order to begin his own personal mission to gain dominance over 
all of the DMA:UE universe. It is said one has not laid eyes on Erebus who was 
not already damned, and that he is known to take the form of people &quot;once 
familiar&quot; to his enemies. He is a chaotic and unpredictable enemy, and he is 
horrendously powerful and not to mention dangerous. None have ever seen his true 
form, not even the Serpent Riders themselves.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="lordminion.gif" width="192"><br>
Lord Minion, Ruler of All Known Evil: Lord Minion is by far THE most powerful 
known evil in not just our physical universe, but all known reality, and he is 
unknowably responsible for Quake's existence. However the truth is, he is not 
PURE evil. He had to expel a very tiny part of his evil[which later manifested 
itself as Quake] in exchange for an equal trade of good, as his brother Lord 
Cyros had to expel a tiny part of his good in exchange for an equal trifle of 
evil to create a &quot;Yin-Yang&quot; like balance[mostly one thing, but not without a 
trace of the other], and because of this, Minion is not actually malignant in 
his own mind, and sees himself somewhat as like a knight of medieval lore, 
possessing honor, bravery, relentlessness and especially chivalry, and because 
of this, he will never attack a woman because he sees them as too weak to defend 
themselves most of the time, and he will never fight dirty and backstab his 
foes. However despite his honorable nature, Minion wishes to be free from the 
bounds of the Realm of Gehenna[the Netherrealm, Hell, etc], and accomplish what 
he believes is his ultimate goal: the wiping of all known reality and existence, 
except himself and Cyros, so the universe may have a second chance to repent for 
what he believes are grievous mistakes made by mortal beings around reality. 
Minion does however, have a fanatic-group of cultists who unfortunately do not 
yet know of their master's honorable streak, and are by no means honorable 
themselves, thus they are a ruthless bunch, and have killed 1000s that have 
gotten in their way. Whether you will meet Minion in person or not is yet to be 
determined, but if you do see him, do not attempt to fight him, for he is 
ETERNAL, which means to be well beyond a common immortal, and he is also 
unharmable, thus one would have to discover an unique way to stop him... Another 
strange quirk is that he actually wishes someday to find a pure good female soul 
to be his 'queen', hoping that his theory of there still being purity in the 
universe is valid. (Minion is only seen and reachable on Extended Mode when you 
defeat Erebus, and only if Tara used the Embrosia Box to trap Quake inside of 
it, and you must face and defeat him if you want a chance to see the TRUE ending 
of the game.)</p>
